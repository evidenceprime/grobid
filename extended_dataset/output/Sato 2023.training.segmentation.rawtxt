Abstract 
Objectives: Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PCC) is a complex disorder 
involving the hepatic hilum. Multiple endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-
atography sessions are necessary for diagnosis and treatment with underly-
ing cholangitis risk. Our aim is to clarify the initial-drainage-related prognostic 
factors of PCC. 
Methods: This study was a single-center retrospective study. A total of 104 
consecutive patients diagnosed with PCC from January 2010 to February 
2020 were enrolled. We defined the diagnostic period as the time between the 
first biliary drainage attempt and the final drainage when treatment, including 
surgery or chemotherapy, was started. We focused on this initial period and 
analyzed the endoscopy-related factors that affected mortality. 
Results: Overall survival of all PCC patients was 599 days.Overall survival of 
surgically treated patients and unresectable patients were 893 days and 512 
days, respectively. In 48 surgically treated patients, drainage-related cholangi-
tis within the diagnostic period, defined as new cholangitis that occurred after 
the first biliary drainage attempt, worsened overall survival from 1460 days to 
607 days. Endoscopic sphincterotomy, the first drainage method other than 
endoscopic nasobiliary drainage, and four or more endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography sessions were risk factors for drainage-related 
cholangitis. Drainage-related cholangitis increased pathological lymph node 
metastasis. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage as final drainage was 
the only prognostic factor in unresectable chemotherapy-treated patients. 
Conclusions: Drainage-related cholangitis worsened the prognosis in PCC 
patients who underwent surgery. Appropriate endoscopic retrograde cholan-
giopancreatography strategies, especially during the diagnostic period, are of 
great importance in PCC.

INTRODUCTION 

Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PCC), located at the hep-
atic hilum, is the most common type of biliary cancer. 1 
Choosing a suitable treatment strategy for PCC is a 
major priority due to its complex origin, where all hepatic 
ducts, arteries, and portal veins gather. Surgical resec-
tion is the only way to cure PCC, as in most solid tumors. 
However, PCC resection requires significant expertise 
and is associated with high mortality, resulting in a 5-
year survival rate below 50%. 2,3 R0 resection is one of 
the strongest prognostic factors for the surgical treat-
ment of PCC. Clarifying the extent of biliary invasion 
in individual hepatic ducts is essential for determin-
ing the possibility of surgical R0 resection. 4 The Bis-
muth classification, focusing on secondary branch inva-
sion, is often used to classify the extent of biliary inva-
sion in PCC. 5 Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-
atography (ERCP) plays a significant role in clarifying 
the extent of invasion both by precise imaging of the 
entire intra-and extrahepatic bile duct and by patholog-
ical diagnosis via step biopsy. The indication for surgi-
cal resection differs between hospitals, and appropriate 
ERCP strategies are based on each center's criteria. 
Biliary obstruction and jaundice are common char-
acteristics associated with PCC. Preoperative biliary 
drainage of the future remnant liver improves liver 
function and enhances regenerative capacities of the 
liver. Incomplete drainage of the remnant liver is 
a mortality risk when the future remnant liver vol-
ume is below 50%. 6 In addition, selective drainage 
of infected segments of the liver decreases mor-
bidity after hepatectomy. 7 A meta-analysis supporting 
preoperative drainage has been reported, suggesting 
that preoperative drainage may decrease postoperative 
morbidity. 8 In contrast, biliary drainage has been repeat-
edly shown to increase postoperative infection-related 
adverse events. 9,10 Cholangitis has been observed 
in 68% of patients with biliary drainage and 0% of 
patients without preoperative drainage. 6 In a meta-
analysis focusing on the effect of preoperative cholan-
gitis on PCC, preoperative cholangitis was associated 
with postoperative mortality, morbidity, risk of liver fail-
ure, and infection. 11 There are pros and cons of pre-
operative biliary drainage, as shown above; however, in 
Japanese clinical practice, preoperative biliary drainage 
is widely performed and expected to benefit patients 
with hepatectomy. 12 
The aim of our study was to clarify the drainage-
related prognostic factors within the diagnostic period 
from the viewpoints of endoscopists. Biliary drainage 
and diagnostic ERCP are essential features of PCC 
diagnosis and treatment. Previous reports concern-
ing PCC have focused mainly on surgical resec-
tion and presurgical factors, and few reports have 
emphasized the importance of factors associated with 

ERCP. Repeated and inappropriate drainage may trig-
ger cholangitis, which increases postoperative morbidity 
and interrupts chemotherapy. Identifying the drainage-
related risks associated with PCC will help those per-
forming ERCP determine what should be done and what 
must be avoided in the primary drainage and diagnosis 
of suspected PCC. 

METHODS 

Patients 

Consecutive patients diagnosed with or treated for PCC 
at Osaka University Hospital from January 2010 to 
February 2020 were included. All patients experienced 
prior expert conferences, and PCC was described as 
the major prognostic factor. The patients eligible for the 
study were identified from our hospital databases and 
were retrospectively reviewed. This study adhered to the 
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Insti-
tutional Review Board of Osaka University (Approval 
Number: 16318). 

Definitions 

Patients with a pathological diagnosis of or presumed 
PCC according to expert conferences were diagnosed 
with PCC. We defined the first biliary drainage attempt 
performed against suspected PCCs as the first drainage. 
Details of the final drainage are described below. In 
surgically treated patients, drainage just before hepa-
tectomy, preoperative hospital discharge, or success-
ful neoadjuvant chemotherapy induction represented 
the final drainage. In unresectable patients receiving 
chemotherapy, biliary drainage in which chemotherapy 
could be started and that was associated with hospi-
tal discharge was referred to as final biliary drainage. In 
patients receiving best supportive care, biliary drainage 
performed just before the best supportive care deci-
sion was used as the final drainage. For our investiga-
tion of diagnostic ERCP and biliary drainage performed 
primarily on suspected PCCs, we defined the period 
between the date of the first drainage and final drainage 
as the diagnostic period (Figure S1). Endoscopists with 
experience of 6-8 years started every ERCP session, 
and experts took cover according to the difficulty of the 
examination. 
Cholangitis was diagnosed according to the Tokyo 
Guidelines 2018. 13 Prediagnostic cholangitis was 
defined as cholangitis before the first drainage, including 
at the time of the first visit to the hospital. Drainage-
related cholangitis was defined as new cholangitis that 
emerged after the first biliary drainage attempt within 
the diagnostic period. In patients with prediagnostic

cholangitis, new cholangitis that occurred after pre-
diagnostic cholangitis had resolved was considered 
drainage-related cholangitis. 
Successful biliary drainage was defined as a 
decrease in the total bilirubin level by 50% or reach-
ing the normal limit within 14 days. 14 To simplify the 
drainage area, we divided the liver into three segments, 
namely, the left lobe, anterior segment, and posterior 
segment, and addressed each segment as being of 
equal value within this study. Post-ERCP pancreatitis 
was defined as an amylase level three times the normal 
limit 24 h after ERCP and concomitant abdominal pain. 
Severity was scored according to Cotton's criteria. 15 
Overall survival (OS) was the time from the first visit 
to the hospital with assumed PCC to the date of death 
regardless of the cause or the last date of the hospital 
visit. Time to diagnosis was the time from the first visit to 
the hospital with suspected PCC to the date of the first 
pathological diagnosis. For staging, the criteria of the 6th 
version of the general rules for clinical and pathologi-
cal studies on cancer of the bile duct published by the 
Japanese Society of Hepatobiliary-Pancreatic Surgery 
were used. Staging and Bismuth classification were 
identified clinically with contrast-enhanced multidetec-
tor computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging 
before drainage or ERCP. Clinical lymph node metas-
tasis was defined as fluorine-18 deoxyglucose accu-
mulation with positron emission tomography-computed 
tomography (CT) or a minor diameter over 10 mm based 
on CT. 

Outcome measurement 

The primary endpoint of this study was to clarify the 
drainage-related prognostic factors within the diagnostic 
period. We focused mainly on the factors related to diag-
nosis and biliary drainage from the viewpoints of endo-
scopists. The variables associated with patient charac-
teristics and ERCP procedures were retrospectively col-
lected based on medical records. 

Statistical analysis 

The data are shown as median values with the range or 
IQR unless otherwise specified. For the univariate anal-
ysis, the Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous 
variables, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for ordi-
nal scale variables, and the chi-square test was used for 
categorical variables. A Cox proportional hazard model 
was used for univariate and multivariate analyses of 
prognostic factors. A logistic regression model was used 
for multivariate analysis to analyze the risk of related 
factors. For the multivariate analysis, factors shown to 
be significant in the univariate analysis were applied. OS 

was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and sta-
tistically evaluated by the log-rank test. A p-value below 
0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses 
were performed with JMP Pro 15 (SAS Institute Inc., 
Tokyo, Japan). 

RESULTS 

Patients 

A total of 119 patients were presumed to have PCC 
from January 2010 to February 2020 at Osaka Univer-
sity Hospital (Figure S2). Fifteen patients were excluded 
for the following reasons: nine with a second opinion 
at our hospital; four referred but returned to the origi-
nal hospital without any treatment; one with recurrent 
PCC primarily treated at a different hospital; and one 
who was referred for radiotherapy and continued treat-
ment at the original hospital. Of the 104 patients ana-
lyzed, 48 underwent surgical resection. Of the 56 unre-
sectable patients, 44 underwent chemotherapy. Patient 
baseline characteristics are shown (Table 1).There were 
68 male and 36 female patients. The median age was 71 
years. Compared with surgically treated patients, unre-
sectable patients had a shorter follow-up period with a 
median of 406 days (vs. 632 days), an advanced clinical 
stage, advanced tumor factor, advanced metastasis fac-
tor, more prediagnostic cholangitis, a longer diagnostic 
period, more frequent ERCP/percutaneous transhepatic 
biliary drainage (PTBD) sessions within the diagnostic 
period, and more drainage-related cholangitis (Table 1). 

Prognostic factors for all 104 PCC patients 

The median survival time (MST) of the 104 PCC 
patients was 599 days (Figure 1a). Univariate analy-
sis indicated that the factors associated with OS in 
all 104 PCC patients were surgical resection, Bis-
muth type, endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), drainage-
related cholangitis, and total bilirubin level (Table 2). 
In the multivariate analysis of these factors, surgical 
resection, Bismuth type, and drainage-related cholangi-
tis were significant factors associated with OS (Table 2). 
Drainage-related cholangitis shortened OS, while surgi-
cal resection and Bismuth type I/II/IIIb improved survival 
(Figure 1b-d). 

Surgically treated patients and prognostic 
factors 

The MST of the 48 patients who underwent surgery 
was 893 days (Figures 1c and 2a). Univariate analy-
sis indicated that the factors associated with OS were

drainage-related cholangitis and endoscopic nasobil-
iary drainage (ENBD) as the first drainage (Table 3). 
In the multivariate analysis, drainage-related cholangi-
tis was the only prognostic factor (HR 4.69, p = 0.003, 
Table 3). The MSTs of the drainage-related cholan-
gitis group and no cholangitis group were 607 and 
1460 days, respectively (p = 0.0005, Figure 2b). The 
risk factors for drainage-related cholangitis in the sur-
gically treated patients were analyzed with a logis-
tic regression model. Univariate analysis showed EST, 
ENBD as the first drainage, and four or more ERCP 
sessions/PTBDs within the diagnostic period as factors 
related to drainage-related cholangitis. In the multivari-
ate analysis, EST (odds ratio [OR] 5.97, p = 0.042), 
ENBD as first drainage (OR 0.17, p = 0.047), and four or 
more ERCP/PTBD sessions within the diagnostic period 
(OR 36.30, p = 0.007) were independent factors of 
drainage-related cholangitis (Table 4). 
Regarding the operative findings, no difference was 
observed between the drainage-related cholangitis 

group and the no cholangitis group with respect to R0 
resection, preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy, 
lymphatic vessel invasion, vascular invasion, and neural 
invasion (Table 5). The percentage of overall recurrence 
did not differ between the drainage-related cholangitis 
group and the no cholangitis group. Changes in patho-
logical lymph node metastasis were the only pathologi-
cal factor related to prognosis observed in the drainage-
related cholangitis group compared with the no cholan-
gitis group (Table 5 and Figure 2c). 

Unresectable patients and prognostic 
factors 

The MST of all 56 unresectable patients was 512 days 
(Figure 1c and Figure S3a). Among the unresectable 
patients, chemotherapy and PTBD as final drainage 
were the prognostic factors upon univariate and multi-
variate analysis (Table S1). The MST of patients with

DISCUSSION 

ERCP plays an important role in patients with sus-
pected PCC. Our study focuses on the period of pri-
mary drainage and diagnosis of suspected PCCs and 
defines this time as the diagnostic period. During this 
period, we often experience a delay in treatment due to 
difficulties associated with biliary drainage and unclear 
histopathological diagnosis. Multiple sessions of ERCP 
frequently cause drainage-related cholangitis, resulting 
in re-drainage. If drainage-related cholangitis can be

treated patients. (a) Median survival time (MST) was 893 days. (b) Patients with drainage-related cholangitis had a shorter overall survival than 
those without cholangitis (MST: 607 days vs. 1460 days, p = 0.0005, log-rank test). (c) Patients with pathological lymph node metastasis had a 
shorter overall survival than those without pathological lymph node metastasis (MST: 607 days vs. 2190 days, p = 0.0001, log-rank test) 

avoided, biliary drainage must have a stronger positive 
influence on the prognosis of PCC patients. Indeed, in 
our study, drainage-related cholangitis was a prognos-
tic factor associated with OS in preoperative patients 
and seemed to be the main prognostic factor within the 
diagnostic period. However, drainage-related cholangitis 
did not affect OS in unresectable and chemotherapy-
treated patients. Most patients with chemotherapy suf-
fer from repeated cholangitis in the overall treatment 
period, resulting in a decrease in the direct impact of 
drainage-related cholangitis within the initial diagnos-
tic period. No endoscopic prognostic factor within the 
diagnostic period could be detected in chemotherapy-
treated patients in our study, and from this point of view, 
the diagnostic period is of stronger importance in surgi-
cally treated patients than in unresectable patients. 
We have shown that EST, multiple drainages within 
the diagnostic period, and ENBD as the first drainage 

were factors associated with drainage-related cholan-
gitis in surgically treated patients. EST, the first fac-
tor detected in our study, and cholangitis are closely 
related. In patients with common bile duct stones, EST 
has been reported to cause acute cholangitis in 31% 
and liver abscess in 11% of patients. 16 In this previ-
ous report, all cholangitis patients had residual intra-
hepatic stones, similar to cholangiocarcinoma in that 
cholestasis occurs in the intrahepatic ducts. EST did 
not decrease the frequency of post-ERCP pancreati-
tis in PCC patients in our study (data not shown), and 
considering these results, EST without any specific rea-
son must be avoided in the diagnostic period for sus-
pected PCC patients. In our study, multiple drainage 
events within the diagnostic period were the second risk 
factor for drainage-related cholangitis. ERCP itself and 
biliary stenting are known risk factors for cholangitis. 6,17

for enteral bacteria to enter the bile duct, which may 
increase the risk of cholangitis. The pre-ERCP strategy 
of diagnosis and appropriate biliary drainage is impor-
tant in reducing the risk of drainage-related cholangi-
tis. Next, ENBD as the first drainage was the third and 
only protective factor against drainage-related cholangi-
tis. The drainage method that is most beneficial to PCC 
patients has always been a question. ENBD is superior 
to endoscopic biliary stenting (EBS) in reducing the risk 
of obstructive cholangitis and stent dysfunction. 18,19 A 
previous study reported that the incidence of stent dys-
function 30 days after the initial drainage was 30% in the 
plastic stent group and 8% in the ENBD group. 19 From 
our data, ENBD within the drainage period did not affect 
the mortality of all PCC patients (data not shown). How-
ever, we have shown that successful first drainage with 

ENBD reduced the risk of drainage-related cholangitis 
in surgically treated PCC patients. In our institute, ENBD 
is the first choice for primary drainage in suspected PCC 
patients given the advantages of ENBD over EBS, such 
as repetitive bile cytology and cholangiography. After 
diagnosing the extent of biliary invasion and confirming 
which segment of the liver needs drainage to maintain 
liver function, we deploy mostly plastic inside stents in 
place of ENBD. ENBD as the first drainage method may 
benefit prediagnosed PCC patients with resectability. 
We investigated why drainage-related segmental 
cholangitis is associated with worse survival in surgi-
cally treated patients. When we compared the drainage-
related cholangitis group with the no cholangitis group, 
more pathological lymph node metastasis was observed 
in the cholangitis group.Pathological lymph node metas-

tasis is one of the strongest prognostic factors for PCC. 
The 5-year survival rate associated with PCC with pN1 
is 20%, while that of PCC with pN0 is 80%. 20 Inap-
propriate cholangiography of the undrained areas may 
trigger drainage-related cholangitis in these areas. The 
increase in intrabiliary pressure and vascular permeabil-
ity due to segmental cholangitis in areas with PCC may 
promote local lymph node metastasis. As in many can-
cers, inflammation of the bile duct and carcinogenesis in 
cholangiocarcinoma are closely related. The known risk 
factors for cholangiocarcinoma are primary sclerosing 
cholangitis and intrahepatic biliary stones, which both 
involve chronic inflammation via cholestasis. Inflamma-
tion is reported to enhance the metastatic abilities of 
cancer cells by maintaining cancer stem cells. 21 The 
proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a triggers endothelial 
mesenchymal transition in cholangiocarcinoma, promot-
ing a tendency toward metastasis. 22 These basic data 
support the possibility that inflammation may shorten 
the OS of PCC patients by promoting lymph node 
metastasis. 
Our study has limitations. First, our study is a single-
center retrospective study. A multicenter randomized 
study is required to show whether the identified factors, 
such as EST, are associated with worse survival via an 
increase in drainage-related cholangitis. We also could 
not collect adequate information to identify the details 
of drainage-related cholangitis because our study was 
retrospective. Therefore, important factors of drainage-
related cholangitis, including whether drainage-related 
cholangitis occurred in drained or undrained areas and 
the reasons for drainage-related cholangitis like inap-
propriate biliary drainage and stent dysfunction, could 
not be assessed. Second, our survival curve was gener-
ated using patient data within 5 years of surgical resec-
tion, making our survival data inaccurate. Therefore, we 
could not analyze recurrence-free survival, an impor-
tant factor in postoperative survival. Third, our stenting 
methods and types of stents used were not consistent 
during the study period. For this reason, we could not 
clarify which type of biliary stenting affects prognosis, 
even though biliary stenting is a major factor in biliary 
drainage in PCC. 
Here, we found that drainage-related cholangitis 
was a prognostic factor for surgically treated patients, 
and EST, multiple ERCP sessions, and ENBD as the 
first drainage were factors related to drainage-related 
cholangitis. PCC requires a multiple biliary approach 
to clarify the possibility of surgical resection and sus-
tain effective drainage. During the diagnostic period, we 
must consider that all patients without obvious distant 
metastasis are candidates for R0 resection. Avoiding 
drainage-related cholangitis within the diagnostic period 
may improve the survival of PCC patients.

Figure S1. Definitions of Diagnostic Period in Perihi-
lar Cholangiocarcinoma. In surgically treated patients, 
the diagnostic period was defined as the time from 
the first biliary drainage to the final drainage surgery 
that was performed, discharge from the hospital prior 
to surgery, or successful neoadjuvant therapy induction. 
In chemotherapy-treated patients, the diagnostic period 
was defined as the time from the first biliary drainage 
to the final drainage, after which chemotherapy-induced 
patients could be discharged from the hospital. In best 
supportive care patients, the diagnostic period was 
defined as the time from the first biliary drainage to the 
final drainage, after which the decision of best support-
ive care was made. 

Figure S2. Patients Enrolled as Having Perihilar 
Cholangiocarcinoma. One hundred nineteen patients 
were presumed to have perihilar cholangiocarcinoma 
from January 2010 to February 2020 at Osaka Univer-
sity Hospital. A total of 104 patients were enrolled in 
this study, and 15 patients were excluded, namely, nine 
patients who received a second opinion, four patients 
who were referred but returned to the original hospi-
tal without treatment, one patient with recurrent perihilar 
cholangiocarcinoma who was primarily treated in a dif-
ferent hospital, and one patient who was referred only 
for radiotherapy and continued treatment at the original 
hospital. 
Figure S3. Overall Survival of Unresectable Patients. 
The overall survival (OS) and chemotherapy treatment 
time of 56 unresectable patients and 44 patients who 
underwent chemotherapy were analyzed by the Kaplan-
Meier method. a) The median survival time (MST) of 
unresectable patients was 512 days. b) Unresectable 
patients who received chemotherapy had a longer OS 
than those who did not receive chemotherapy (MST: 536 
days vs. 204 days, p = 0.0090, log-rank test). c) Unre-
sectable patients with Percutaneous Transhepatic Bil-
iary Drainage (PTBD) had a shorter OS than those with-
out PTBD (MST: 209 days vs. 536 days, p = 0.0005, log-
rank test). d) Chemotherapy patients with PTBD had a 
shorter OS than those without PTBD (MST: 209 days vs. 
478.5 days, p = 0.0040, log-rank test).
