Subjects were screened for allergic <lb/>rhinitis using the Score For Allergic Rhinitis questionnaire. Current prevalence (last 12 months) was estimated. Disease <lb/>severity and control were assessed using the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma classification and Rhinitis <lb/>Control Assessment Test respectively. Quality of sleep, impact on daily activities and quality of life were measured <lb/>using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Sheehan Disability Scale and EuroQol Five-Dimension questionnaire respectively. <lb/>Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate risk factors and co-morbidities. <lb/>Results: 1808 of 33,486 subjects enrolled in the SNAPSHOT program fulfilled the case definition for allergic rhinitis. <lb/>Prevalence was 3.6% [95% CI 3.2-4.0%] in Egypt, 6.4% [95% CI 5.9-6.9%] in Turkey and 6.4% [95% CI 6.0-6.9%] in <lb/>the Gulf cluster. Risk factors identified were country, co-morbid asthma and income. Subjects with allergic rhinitis <lb/>reported a significantly lower quality of life compared to the general population (p &lt; 0.0001). Overall, 55% of allergic <lb/>rhinitis subjects were moderate/severe and 33% were uncontrolled. Both these groups reported impaired quality <lb/>of life and quality of sleep and increased impairment of daily activities compared to mild/well-controlled subjects <lb/>(p &lt; 0.0001). <lb/>Conclusions: Although the observed prevalence of allergic rhinitis in these Middle Eastern countries is low <lb/>compared to western countries, its burden is considerable. Allergic rhinitis in general, and specifically uncontrolled <lb/>and severe disease, results in a negative impact on quality of life, quality of sleep and daily activities. <lb/>Keywords: Allergic rhinitis, Clinical burden, Middle East, SNAPSHOT, Quality of life <lb/>Â© The Author(s) 2018.

			<body>Background <lb/>Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is a common inflammatory <lb/>disorder affecting the nasal membranes characterised <lb/>by symptoms such as sneezing and nasal congestion. <lb/>It is a global health problem; conservative estimates <lb/>suggest that approximately 500 million people worldwide <lb/>are affected by the disease. The burden of AR is often <lb/>under-estimated since the disease is not life-threatening. <lb/>However, it can cause significant morbidity, through <lb/>both the physical symptoms and its impact on quality of <lb/>life and well-being [1]. It has a profound effect on many <lb/>aspects of daily life such as sleep [2], work/school [3], <lb/>and social life, having been shown to result in fatigue and <lb/>mood changes [4], to impair cognitive function [5], and <lb/>to lead to depression and anxiety [6]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Large scale multinational studies that have collected data <lb/>on the prevalence of AR in adults are rare and those that <lb/>have taken place use different study methodologies and <lb/>case definitions, and report a wide range of prevalence <lb/>estimates. Several studies have been conducted in Western <lb/>Europe and the United States (US). For example, one <lb/>study carried out in six European countries (Belgium, <lb/>France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom <lb/>(UK)) using the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on <lb/>Asthma (ARIA) definition of AR reported that overall, the <lb/>prevalence of AR, confirmed by clinical examination was <lb/>22.7%. However, the prevalence varied between countries <lb/>from 16.9% in Italy to 28.5% in Belgium [7]. Data from <lb/>the Burden of Rhinitis in America study reported the <lb/>prevalence of rhinitis associated with seasonal or perennial <lb/>rhinitis to range between 11.9% and 30.2% depending on <lb/>duration of symptoms and physician diagnosis [8]. <lb/>Data on the prevalence and burden of AR outside <lb/>of these areas, and in the Middle East particularly, <lb/>is scarce. Most studies have been carried out among <lb/>school children, many of which have been based <lb/>on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies <lb/>in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaires and a wide <lb/>variation in prevalence has been reported. Differences <lb/>in prevalence have been reported between countries in <lb/>the region and prevalence has also been shown to vary <lb/>between the age groups of the children included in the <lb/>studies. For example, a nationwide survey in Oman <lb/>reported a 7.4% prevalence of AR in 6-7 year olds and <lb/>a 10.5% prevalence in 13-14 year olds, whereas a study <lb/>in Qatar reported a 30.5% prevalence of physician <lb/>diagnosed AR in children between 6 and 14 years old. <lb/>Studies in adults have been carried out in the United <lb/>Arab Emirates (UAE) [9], and Turkey [10-13] and the <lb/>Allergies In the Middle East Survey (AIMES) reported <lb/>the prevalence of AR in adults across five Middle Eastern <lb/>countries (Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and the <lb/>UAE). However, once again, these studies use varying <lb/>case definitions and a range of study designs making it <lb/>difficult to compare the results. <lb/>To address the need for data in the Middle East on the <lb/>prevalence and burden of AR, the SNAPSHOT program <lb/>was conducted; a large, cross-sectional, population-<lb/>based program using a standardised methodology <lb/>in five countries in the region (Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi <lb/>Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE), to investigate the current <lb/>prevalence and disease burden attributable to AR in the <lb/>adult population of these five countries. <lb/>Methods <lb/>The SNAPSHOT Program <lb/>SNAPSHOT is a multi-national, cross-sectional, <lb/>population-based <lb/>program, <lb/>comprising <lb/>multiple <lb/>studies, conducted in a random sample of the adult <lb/>general population of five countries (Egypt, Kuwait, <lb/>Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE), between July 2014 <lb/>and February 2016. The objective of the SNAPSHOT <lb/>program was to provide an omnibus approach to collect <lb/>data simultaneously about multiple diseases using <lb/>a standardised methodology. The program provides <lb/>updated epidemiological data on the prevalence, burden <lb/>of disease, quality of life and healthcare resource use <lb/>related to four chronic diseases in the participating <lb/>countries: asthma, AR, bipolar disorder and benign <lb/>prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The selection of these <lb/>diseases was based on the need to respond to emerging <lb/>health technology assessment (HTA) requirements by <lb/>local authorities in these Middle Eastern countries. The <lb/>complete methodology and program rationale have been <lb/>described in detail elsewhere [14]. <lb/>A quota of 10,000 subjects from the adult general <lb/>population of Turkey and Egypt and 15,000 from the <lb/>Gulf cluster (comprised of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the <lb/>UAE) was targeted based on the demographic structure <lb/>of the country in terms of age and gender, using a <lb/>random stratified sampling method. In the Gulf cluster, <lb/>it was difficult to reach the target sample size, and since <lb/>the combined number of interviews conducted to date <lb/>in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE showed that the <lb/>program objectives could be achieved from a sample size <lb/>perspective, recruitment was stopped in February 2016 <lb/>and the database locked on the 11th of April 2016. <lb/>Subjects first responded to a screening questionnaire <lb/>to identify subjects fulfilling the criteria for each <lb/>of the diseases and record social and demographic <lb/>characteristics, as well as the presence of co-morbidities. <lb/>Respondents who met the criteria for one or more <lb/>diseases were invited to continue the interview by <lb/>replying to a detailed, disease-specific questionnaire. This <lb/>questionnaire collected additional information on burden <lb/>of disease, disease management and healthcare resource <lb/>utilisation. Data on quality of life were also captured using <lb/>the three level EuroQoL Five-Dimension questionnaire <lb/>(EQ-5D-3L) (Â© EuroQol Research Foundation. EQ-5D â¢ <lb/>is a trade mark of the EuroQol Research Foundation) [15, <lb/>16]. <lb/>Case definition <lb/>Subjects were screened for AR based on the Score For <lb/>Allergic Rhinitis (SFAR) questionnaire, a validated <lb/>screening tool which consists of 10 items with a score <lb/>ranging from 0 to 16 [17]. The full questionnaire is <lb/></body>

The SFAR questionnaire was presented in the <lb/>language of the country where the study took place. <lb/>The translated versions of the SFAR questionnaire in <lb/>all three languages of the SNAPSHOT program were <lb/>provided for use by the author and copyright holder of <lb/>the questionnaire. Validation of the SFAR questionnaire <lb/>can also be found in the literature [17], and translated <lb/>versions have been previously used in Turkey [13], and <lb/>the Maghreb [18]. <lb/>Data collected for this analysis <lb/>The analysis presented here focuses solely on AR and <lb/>aims to provide estimates of the current prevalence <lb/>of AR and demonstrate the burden of disease in the <lb/>countries studied. AR prevalence data were collected <lb/>using the case definition described and adjusted by <lb/>age, gender and country. Socio-demographic data <lb/>were collected to describe the characteristics of the <lb/>overall program population, including gender and age <lb/>distribution, height and weight (body mass index (BMI) <lb/>was calculated), the presence of co-morbid conditions, <lb/>family history of the disease and smoking status. If a <lb/>respondent was a current or former smoker, they were <lb/>asked to provide the duration and extent of exposure. <lb/>Additionally, the type and frequency of co-morbidities <lb/>was investigated and risk factors for AR were identified. <lb/>As part of the screening questionnaire, subjects were <lb/>also screened for asthma using a case definition based <lb/>on the global Asthma Insights and Reality (AIR) <lb/>surveys [20]. <lb/>Table 1 Score For Allergic Rhinitis (SFAR) questionnaire <lb/>The score for allergic questionnaire, consists of 10 questionnaires, scored as indicated in the table.

Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol (2018) 14:63 <lb/>Control of AR was assessed using the Rhinitis <lb/>Control Assessment Test (RCAT), a six item self-report <lb/>questionnaire with responses on a five-point scale [21]. <lb/>Symptom control over the past week was assessed; a <lb/>score â¤ 21 indicates that rhinitis symptoms are not <lb/>well-controlled and a score &gt; 21 indicates that rhinitis <lb/>symptoms are well controlled. Severity of the disease <lb/>was assessed based on the 2008 ARIA classification, <lb/>with symptoms being classed as mild or moderate/ <lb/>severe depending on the severity of symptoms and their <lb/>impact on social life and school/work [1]. <lb/>The level of daytime sleepiness was measured using <lb/>the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), which is an eight-<lb/>item self-report questionnaire, where respondents are <lb/>asked to rate their usual chance of falling asleep while <lb/>engaged in eight different activities on a four-point <lb/>scale (0-3) [22]. A total score between zero and five <lb/>indicates lower normal daytime sleepiness; between <lb/>six and ten denotes higher normal daytime sleepiness; <lb/>between 11 and 12 indicates mild excessive daytime <lb/>sleepiness; between 13 and 15 indicates moderate <lb/>excessive daytime sleepiness; and between 16 and 24 <lb/>indicates excessive daytime sleepiness. <lb/>Daily activities were assessed using a modified <lb/>version of the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a patient <lb/>reported outcome measure for assessing impairment of <lb/>functioning in three major daily activities (work/school <lb/>life; social life/leisure activities and family life/home <lb/>responsibilities). In this study, the standard response <lb/>options metric was modified to scoring on a 5-point <lb/>Likert scale to accommodate data capture during a <lb/>telephone interview. The response options used were <lb/>&apos;not at all/mildly/moderately/markedly/extremely&apos; . <lb/>During the analysis of the results, a &apos;not at all&apos; was <lb/>classified as &apos;no&apos; and a response of &apos;mildly/moderately/ <lb/>markedly/extremely&apos; was classified as &apos;yes&apos; . In this study, <lb/>the timeframe used to assess symptom impact was <lb/>&quot;over the past 12 months&quot;. (The SDS was used with the <lb/>permission of the SDS copyright holder Professor DV <lb/>Sheehan. Â© Sheehan DV 1996 &amp; 2008 &amp; 2016) [23, 24]. <lb/>All subjects were also asked to complete the <lb/>EQ-5D-3L questionnaire to measure quality of life, a <lb/>generic questionnaire designed as a measure of health <lb/>status which aims to capture the impact of a disease <lb/>on physical, mental, and social functioning. The <lb/>questionnaire consists of five dimensions (mobility, <lb/>self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/ <lb/>depression) each of which can take one of three <lb/>responses (no problems/moderate problems/extreme <lb/>problems) and a visual analogue rating scale (EQ-VAS) <lb/>[15, 16]. <lb/>All questionnaires were used in their validated English, <lb/>Turkish or Arabic versions. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Data are presented as proportions and means with <lb/>standard deviations (SD), and 95% confidence intervals <lb/>(95% CI) were calculated for binomial data. Associations <lb/>between variables were estimated using the Ï 2 test and <lb/>the Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate. Two-sided tests <lb/>were used in all cases and a probability threshold of <lb/>0.05 was considered significant. Multivariate regression <lb/>analysis was performed to identify the risk factors <lb/>associated with AR. In the first step, specified variables <lb/>were evaluated independently in a univariate analysis. <lb/>All variables with a p value &lt; 0.20 [25] in the univariate <lb/>analysis were entered into the multiple logistic regression <lb/>analysis. Variables were retained in the model using a <lb/>backward selection to identify those associated with <lb/>an increased risk of AR at the probability level of <lb/>0.05. A final multivariate analysis was performed to <lb/>generate odds ratios. Multivariate regression analysis <lb/>was also performed to assess the relationship between <lb/>co-morbidities and AR independent of age, gender and <lb/>country. All statistical analyses were performed using <lb/>SAS Â® Version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, USA). <lb/>Results <lb/>Study sample <lb/>A total of 33,486 subjects agreed to participate in the <lb/>program, completed all the screening questionnaires <lb/>and thus constituted the screening population. This <lb/>population was distributed between Egypt (10,014), <lb/>Turkey (10,000) and the Gulf cluster (13,472). Of the <lb/>subjects enrolled in the program, 1808 fulfilled the case <lb/>definition for AR and were defined as the AR population. <lb/>This was the population used to calculate the prevalence <lb/>of AR and investigate the risk factors, association with <lb/>co-morbidities and impact on quality of life. Of these <lb/>1808 subjects, 857 (47.4%) completed the entire detailed <lb/>AR questionnaire and constituted the AR responders <lb/>used to investigate the burden of disease. This included <lb/>an assessment of the severity and control of AR reported <lb/>by the subjects and the impact on activities of daily living, <lb/>quality of life and daytime sleepiness. <lb/>Selected demographics of the SNAPSHOT population <lb/>and those subjects with AR are shown in Table 2. <lb/>Demographically, there were few major differences <lb/>between the 857 subjects with AR that completed the <lb/>detailed questionnaire and the 1808 subjects who <lb/>constituted the total AR population. The distribution in <lb/>terms of age, gender, BMI, and smoking status is similar <lb/>between the two populations (overall AR population <lb/>and AR responders). The main difference between these <lb/></body>

			<body>(ESS 16-24) compared to those with well-controlled <lb/>symptoms (16.3%) (p &lt; 0.0001); see Fig. 5. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>This study reports a considerable burden of disease <lb/>attributable to AR in the five countries studied. Subjects <lb/>with AR reported a significant impact on activities of <lb/>daily living and a negative impact on quality of life, <lb/>both of which were exacerbated in severe or not well-<lb/>controlled subjects. The prevalence of AR was found to <lb/>be relatively low compared to that reported elsewhere. <lb/>The lower prevalence of AR, compared to figures <lb/>reported in Europe and the US [7, 8], could be due to <lb/>many factors, such as cultural differences between the <lb/>countries taking part. In addition, due to environmental <lb/>differences between countries, subjects in the Middle <lb/>East are likely to be exposed to different allergens, which <lb/>may influence the reported prevalence. <lb/>Overall 1808 subjects screened positively for AR. Of <lb/>the overall AR population, 47.4% (n = 857) completed <lb/>the detailed questionnaire which collected data <lb/>on disease management and were termed the AR <lb/>responders. Demographically, there were few major <lb/>differences between the AR responders and the overall <lb/>AR population. The distribution in terms of age, gender, <lb/>BMI, and smoking status is similar between the two <lb/>populations. However, differences are apparent with <lb/>respect to health system coverage. A higher proportion of <lb/>subjects in the AR responders group are covered by social <lb/>security and a lower proportion are uninsured. This <lb/>difference is probably due to the relative contribution <lb/>of the three countries/cluster involved, which have <lb/>significant differences in terms of the healthcare <lb/>coverage available. In Turkey, most of the population <lb/>(90%) has healthcare coverage through a social security <lb/>system, while in the Gulf cluster healthcare coverage is <lb/>expanding through medical insurance as increasingly <lb/>more individuals receive healthcare in a reimbursed <lb/>manner. In Egypt, for much of the population, healthcare <lb/>is paid by patients out of pocket. The response rate in <lb/>the three countries/cluster differed. There is a higher <lb/>percentage of Turkish subjects in the AR responder <lb/>population (56%) compared to the overall AR population <lb/>(34%), which is reflected in the higher proportion of AR <lb/>responders covered by social security compared to the <lb/>overall AR population. Given the potential impact of this <lb/>on the parameters associated with disease management <lb/>outcomes, such as quality of life, severity and control, <lb/>these results have been presented by country. <lb/>The SFAR questionnaire is a validated self-report <lb/>measure, which considers most features of the disease <lb/>(clinical symptoms, seasonality, family history, medical <lb/>history and perceived allergy) to screen for AR, and <lb/>is considered to have a higher level of sensitivity and <lb/>specificity than many other questionnaires used to <lb/>screen for the disease, such as that used in the European <lb/>Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECHRS). <lb/>However, it is possible that in this study, the first question <lb/>of the SFAR questionnaire excluded many subjects due to <lb/>unawareness of AR as a disease in the Middle East. Many <lb/>subjects, particularly those with mild symptoms, in the <lb/>absence of a physician diagnosis of AR, might interpret <lb/>their recurrent nasal symptoms as being due to a cold or <lb/>sinus disease and answer no to the first SFAR question <lb/>Table 4 Characteristics of the allergic rhinitis (AR) <lb/>population <lb/>Characteristics of the allergic rhinitis (AR) population.

			<body>and be excluded from the rest of the questionnaire. In line <lb/>with this, almost 60% of AR subjects in SNAPSHOT have <lb/>ARIA defined moderate/severe disease (approximately <lb/>three quarters of subjects in Egypt and the Gulf cluster) <lb/>suggesting that many subjects with mild disease may <lb/>have been missed due to unawareness of the disease. In <lb/>other countries in Europe and North America, where <lb/>the SFAR questionnaire has been used widely, and <lb/>awareness of AR is higher, the first question is necessary <lb/>to eliminate subjects who would otherwise be wrongly <lb/>classified. Moving forward, a modified version of the <lb/>SFAR, may be needed in the Middle East to account for <lb/>the cultural differences in the region and avoid missing <lb/>subjects who would otherwise screen positive for the <lb/>disease. It should also be noted that the SFAR can assess <lb/>AR when the disease is not symptomatic. It is possible to <lb/>reach a score of six or seven points from questions other <lb/>than those on nasal symptoms. Although this does not <lb/>happen frequently, it has been observed and can reduce <lb/>the possibility of misclassification of subjects. Although <lb/>the reported prevalence estimates from SNAPSHOT <lb/>are low, the individuals identified are likely to represent <lb/>the more severe end of the spectrum where the impact <lb/>of AR is greatest and where medical intervention is <lb/>most needed. In addition, some subjects may already be <lb/>taking medications for AR. These subjects may not have <lb/>experienced AR nasal symptoms in the past 12 months <lb/>due to an effective treatment strategy, and therefore <lb/>answered no to question one of the SFAR. Thus, <lb/>although question eight asks about a previous physician <lb/>diagnosis of AR, some subjects with well-treated <lb/>physician diagnosed AR and therefore not experiencing <lb/>bothersome symptoms, may have been excluded from <lb/>the AR population, contributing to the lower prevalence <lb/>estimate observed. Therefore, the estimates provided on <lb/>AR prevalence and its symptoms in the Middle East in the <lb/>SNAPSHOT study can be considered as conservative. For <lb/>future studies on AR in the Middle East, it could be <lb/>considered to first ask questions about the physician <lb/>confirmed AR diagnosis and medication usage since the <lb/>dates of diagnosis, followed up by questions about the AR <lb/>symptoms. This will enable a chronological view of the <lb/>AR diagnosis, disease management, and patient journey <lb/>to be obtained which can help in better understanding <lb/>the level of AR prevalence and symptoms. <lb/>Limited data is available on the prevalence of AR in <lb/>adults across the Middle East, and prevalence estimates <lb/>vary widely both between countries and within countries. <lb/>For example, one study carried out across all seven <lb/>Emirates of the UAE used the ECRHS to screen for AR, <lb/>and reported that at least 7% of the study population <lb/>had the disease [9]. Another study conducted in Al Ain <lb/>city in the UAE used a modified version of the ISAAC <lb/>questionnaire, and reported a much higher prevalence <lb/>at 32% [26]. Many factors are likely to contribute to <lb/>this difference; such as the case definition and study <lb/>Fig. 3 Impact of allergic rhinitis on quality of life. Quality of life was assessed using the three level EuroQol Five Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) <lb/>a EQ-5D-3L utility values for the allergic rhinitis (AR) population and general population by country b EQ-VAS scores for the AR population and <lb/>general population by country.

The prevalence of <lb/>AR reported in AIMES is higher than SNAPSHOT, <lb/>however, there were methodological differences in <lb/>this study that may have contributed this finding. <lb/>In AIMES the study was not restricted to adults; all <lb/>subjects â¥ 4 years old were eligible to participate. In <lb/>addition, AIMES used a custom-designed questionnaire <lb/>where a positive screening was based on a physician <lb/>diagnosis of AR and experiencing symptoms and/ <lb/>or receiving treatment in the last 12 months. It was <lb/>also mentioned that during the survey other terms <lb/>that could be used to describe AR were also provided <lb/>to the subject, (since it was thought that AR may not <lb/>have been a familiar term in the countries where <lb/>the interviews took place), to ensure that the survey <lb/>captured all subjects with the condition.

			<body>AR as a condition, may have contributed to the low <lb/>prevalence observed. <lb/>A variety of studies have been conducted in adults in <lb/>Turkey. Two studies have been conducted using the <lb/>ECRHS questionnaire. In Manisa, the reported AR <lb/>prevalence in adults was 14.5% [10]. In a separate study <lb/>in Antalya the reported prevalence was 27.7% [11]. The <lb/>Prevalence And Risk Factors of Allergies In Turkey <lb/>(PARFAIT) study investigated the prevalence of AR <lb/>across 14 cities in Turkey and reported the prevalence <lb/>of AR in males to be 11.7% in urban areas and 17.5% in <lb/>rural areas, compared to 17.0% and 21.2% respectively <lb/>for females [12]. Two separate population-based studies <lb/>have been carried out in adults in Turkey, across seven <lb/>geographical regions of the country. One study used <lb/>a custom-designed questionnaire focused mainly on <lb/>descriptive parameters and based the definition of AR on <lb/>the ARIA guidelines. The reported prevalence from this <lb/>study ranged from 16.3% in the Eastern Anatolia region <lb/>to 27.5% in the Marmara region [28]. The second study <lb/>used the SFAR questionnaire and reported an overall self-<lb/>reported prevalence of 29.6% for the whole study group. <lb/>In line with the previous study, the highest prevalence <lb/>of self-reported AR was reported in the Marmara <lb/>region (36.1%) and the lowest was reported in South <lb/>East Anatolia region (21%) [13]. The only other study <lb/>in the Middle East which used the SFAR questionnaire <lb/>was carried out in Aydin and reported a 12-month <lb/>prevalence of AR in adults of 14% [29]. These differences <lb/>in prevalence may be due to many factors, such as <lb/>differences in population selection, the characteristics of <lb/>the population, the period of the year in which the survey <lb/>was conducted or environmental factors. Without a like <lb/>for like comparison of case definition it is difficult to <lb/>compare. <lb/>Control of AR is essentially seen as absence of <lb/>symptoms and is an important measure which few <lb/>previous studies in the Middle East have addressed. <lb/>The AIMES survey reported that less than half (40%) of <lb/>respondents felt their symptoms were completely or well-<lb/>controlled, and 15% described their symptoms as poorly <lb/>or not controlled, despite the majority taking medication <lb/>to treat their symptoms [27]. In contrast, the majority <lb/>of subjects with AR in the SNAPSHOT program (67%) <lb/>reported their symptoms were controlled. This could be <lb/>due to the different methods used to measure control in <lb/>the two studies, patient perception in the AIMES study <lb/>versus the RCAT in the SNAPSHOT program. <lb/>It is well established that AR has a profound effect on <lb/>quality of life, having a significant impact on activities <lb/>such as sleep [2, 30], work, and social life [31]. Two-thirds <lb/>of patients who took part in the Allergies in America <lb/>survey, which included 2500 adults aged 18 years or <lb/>older who had been diagnosed with AR, nasal allergies <lb/>or hay fever and were symptomatic or had been treated <lb/>for nasal allergies within the last 12 months reported <lb/>Fig. 5 Impact of allergic rhinitis control on daytime sleepiness. Impact of AR control measured using the Rhinitis Control Assessment Test (RCAT) on <lb/>reported levels of daytime sleepiness, measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The p value was calculated using the X 2 test <lb/></body>

			<body>that AR affected their daily life [32]. Regional data from <lb/>the AIMES study reported that 58% of respondents <lb/>felt their daily life was impacted by the disease; 72% of <lb/>respondents reported their performance at work/school <lb/>was affected and 80% reported that AR impacted their <lb/>sleep [27]. The SNAPSHOT results are in line with the <lb/>literature; subjects with AR reported a significant impact <lb/>on quality of life across all countries and the cluster of <lb/>countries studied, which was amplified in more severe <lb/>disease and disease that was not controlled, which is <lb/>also supported in the literature. For example, a French <lb/>study in 3052 patients consulting general practitioners <lb/>for AR investigated the effects of severity and duration <lb/>(intermittent or persistent) of AR on impairment of <lb/>quality of life, sleep and work performance. Disease <lb/>severity had more of an effect than duration and the <lb/>majority (80%) of those with moderate/severe disease <lb/>reported impaired activities, compared to only 40% of <lb/>those with mild symptoms [33]. <lb/>The impact of AR on daily activities was assessed using <lb/>the SDS. The SDS was modified for use in this program <lb/>from its usual 0 to 10 point discretized analogue layout <lb/>anchored both numerically, verbally descriptively and <lb/>visually spatially into 5 response option categories (a <lb/>score of 0 = not at all, 1-3 = mildly, 4-6 = moderately, <lb/>7-9 = markedly, 10 = extremely). Accordingly, data <lb/>analysis was discussed with the scale author to ensure <lb/>correct interpretation of the results. The use of the <lb/>12-month time frame in this study enables the data to be <lb/>more relevant for governments and healthcare bodies to <lb/>aid in developing healthcare policy. The questionnaire <lb/>has been validated for use in face-to-face interviews, but <lb/>was administered by telephone in SNAPSHOT, which <lb/>should not affect the validity of the data collected. <lb/>It has frequently been reported that AR results in <lb/>increased daytime sleepiness. For example, a clinical <lb/>trial comparing 25 healthy individuals with 25 people <lb/>with seasonal AR found a significant increase in daytime <lb/>sleepiness reported by those with AR and these patients <lb/>also reported significant impairment to their quality <lb/>of life. The impact was related to the severity of the <lb/>disease [34]. Interestingly, data from SNAPSHOT shows <lb/>that most subjects experience low levels of daytime <lb/>sleepiness, despite over half describing their symptoms as <lb/>moderate/severe. However, this may be a consequence of <lb/>most subjects reporting symptom control. <lb/>As with all studies, limitations do exist. These include <lb/>the fact the survey was telephone based, which could <lb/>introduce a sampling bias if certain groups do not have <lb/>access to a telephone, such as those in more remote, rural <lb/>areas. However, the SNAPSHOT program considered <lb/>both mobile and fixed landline telephone numbers to be <lb/>eligible, and the emergence of mobile telephones means <lb/>that most households in these countries have access <lb/>to a telephone. The survey was conducted by trained <lb/>lay interviewers; and the case definition is based on <lb/>perceived symptoms with no physician confirmation. <lb/>However, the clinical definition of AR is difficult to <lb/>implement in an epidemiological setting where large <lb/>populations are studied, since it is not possible to obtain <lb/>laboratory evidence of an immune response. As is the <lb/>case for all studies that require participants to recall <lb/>data, there is a risk of inaccuracy in the data collected. In <lb/>addition, as explained in detail earlier, the interpretation <lb/>of the first question of the SFAR in this region is likely <lb/>to have excluded a number of subjects with AR from the <lb/>program resulting in a potential underestimation of the <lb/>prevalence of AR in the countries studied. It is important <lb/>to collect data on symptoms of AR in such countries, <lb/>since awareness of AR as a disease is low in the region. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>This study provides an updated prevalence estimate for <lb/>AR and information on the disease burden within the <lb/>adult general population of five countries in the Middle <lb/>East region, using an identical methodology across all <lb/>countries studied. Although the observed prevalence <lb/>of AR in these Middle Eastern countries is lower <lb/>than that reported in western countries, its burden is <lb/>considerable. AR, and specifically uncontrolled and <lb/>severe disease results in a negative impact on quality <lb/>of life, quality of sleep and daily activities. The results <lb/>from this study can contribute to informed decision <lb/>making when setting priorities for public health policy <lb/>and strategy to manage AR in these countries. <lb/></body>
