Health technol-<lb/>ogy appraisal agencies often require cost-utility analysis when assessing new interventions. Appropriate utility estimates, <lb/>which quantify the value of different conditions in cost-utility analyses, are scarce for allergic rhinitis and asthma health <lb/>states. This study aimed to generate utilities for allergic rhinitis and asthma health states from a European general population <lb/>sample of adults and children. <lb/>Methods Health state descriptions incorporating symptoms, impact of symptoms on daily life and symptom treatment were <lb/>developed using clinical guidelines. Descriptions were amended with clinician and patient input, and incorporated into a <lb/>survey in which each health state was followed by a standard gamble (adults) or visual analogue scale (children) item. The <lb/>survey was distributed to samples of adults and children aged 8 to 11 from four European countries that were stratified to <lb/>represent the general population within that country. <lb/>Results 1454 adults and 1082 children completed the survey. Mean health utilities ranged from 0.635 to 0.880 and those <lb/>elicited in children were lower (0.635 to 0.705) than those elicited in adults (0.812 to 0.880). Disutilities assessing the impact <lb/>of increased allergic rhinitis severity and comorbidities were also greater in children than in adults. <lb/>Conclusions Symptoms of allergic rhinitis and asthma were valued as having a clinically meaningful impact on HRQoL. <lb/>Children valued health states as poorer than adults, and further research should investigate whether this reflects true prefer-<lb/>ential differences or results from methodological and/or comprehension differences between the two groups. <lb/>Keywords Utility elicitation • Standard gamble • Visual analogue scale • Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis • Asthma • Children <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Background <lb/>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory condition <lb/>affecting the upper airways, caused by an excess of immu-<lb/>noglobin E produced in response to environmental allergens <lb/>such as house dust mites and pollen. AR affects 17-26% of <lb/>the population in Europe, with prevalence expected to rise <lb/>[1]. While the symptoms of nasal blockage, sneezing and <lb/>itching [2] may be thought of as trivial, research shows they <lb/>have a detrimental impact on health-related quality of life <lb/>(HRQoL), disturbing sleep, concentration and productivity <lb/>at work or school, and the ability to conduct daily activities <lb/>and causing widespread discomfort [3, 4]. <lb/>The persistence and nature of symptoms experienced can <lb/>vary depending on the allergen(s) responsible and the pat-<lb/>tern of exposure. When AR is triggered by pollen, ocular <lb/>inflammation can occur alongside nasal symptoms, broad-<lb/>ening the condition to allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC), <lb/>commonly known as &apos;hay fever&apos;. Individuals may respond to <lb/>multiple allergens, and AR/ARC is further complicated by <lb/>commonly presenting with asthma, a chronic inflammatory <lb/>condition of the lower airways that causes coughing, wheez-<lb/>ing, chest tightness and breathlessness [5]. <lb/></body>

			<body>1 3 <lb/>AR/ARC is found in over 80% of asthma patients, and <lb/>asthma is found in 20-60% of those with AR/ARC [6], <lb/>leading researchers to hypothesise that AR/ARC and <lb/>asthma are manifestations of the same disease, affecting <lb/>different parts of a &apos;united airway&apos; [7]. Moreover, AR/ <lb/>ARC often precedes asthma onset, and has been shown to <lb/>be one of the strongest independent risk factors for asthma <lb/>development [6], with evidence that AR/ARC can increase <lb/>the risk of adult-onset asthma threefold [8] and that AR <lb/>severity can impact asthma symptom control [6]. Once <lb/>developed, asthma commonly requires lifelong treatment <lb/>[5], with comorbid disease impacting HRQoL to a greater <lb/>extent than AR or asthma alone, particularly detrimental <lb/>to physical functioning [3, 9]. <lb/>Recommended first-line treatments for AR/ARC are usu-<lb/>ally allergen avoidance and pharmacological symptom man-<lb/>agement [1, 6]. It can be difficult to avoid airborne allergens <lb/>like pollen and house dust mites, however, and symptom-<lb/>relieving medications, commonly anti-histamine or corti-<lb/>costeroid based, do not target the cause of the disease, and <lb/>are therefore unlikely to prevent asthma onset [10]. For some <lb/>patients, these treatment options are ineffective, and even <lb/>where symptoms are managed successfully, patients are <lb/>required to maintain daily treatment indefinitely. Allergy <lb/>immunotherapy (AIT) is a treatment option available to <lb/>patients with AR/ARC whose symptoms are not adequately <lb/>controlled by symptom-relieving medication. AIT aims to <lb/>desensitise the immune response to trigger allergens, thereby <lb/>treating the underlying disease. Evidence indicates that AIT <lb/>in childhood can reduce the risk of developing comorbid <lb/>asthma 7 years after treatment [10]. <lb/>Health technology appraisal agencies increasingly stipu-<lb/>late cost-utility analysis (CUA) as a part of the assessment <lb/>of new technologies. CUA compares the incremental costs <lb/>and health benefits of two or more interventions. Health <lb/>benefits are measured as health utilities, allowing for stand-<lb/>ardised comparison across different disease areas. Health <lb/>utilities represent the value a particular population places <lb/>on the impact of a health condition on HRQoL, thereby <lb/>combining HRQoL with the &apos;desirability&apos; of a condition. <lb/>Correspondingly, disutility can also be measured. Disutil-<lb/>ity represents the decrement in utility due to a particular <lb/>symptom or complication, and is calculated by measuring <lb/>the difference between two health states that are identical <lb/>in all aspects aside from the complication or symptoms of <lb/>interest [11]. <lb/>Utility inputs for the different combinations of seasonal <lb/>ARC and associated health states that may be required for <lb/>CUA are scarce, and, to our knowledge, non-existent in pae-<lb/>diatric populations. This study aimed to generate a set of <lb/>utilities and disutilities from four European countries for <lb/>seasonal ARC and associated conditions, in both adult and <lb/>paediatric populations, for use in future cost-utility analyses. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Ethical approval <lb/>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declara-<lb/>tion of Helsinki and ethical approval was granted by the <lb/>University of York Health Sciences research ethics com-<lb/>mittee. Informed parental consent was provided for all child <lb/>respondents. <lb/>Health states <lb/>Fourteen health states (Table 1) were defined that repre-<lb/>sented three levels of severity in ARC (mild, moderate and <lb/>severe), during and outside pollen season, in combination <lb/>with comorbidities of asthma, and allergic rhinitis triggered <lb/>by perennial allergens. Vignettes describing these states <lb/>were developed using current clinical guidelines (Allergic <lb/>Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) [12], Global Ini-<lb/>tiative of Asthma (GINA) [13]) to incorporate (i) symptoms, <lb/>(ii) how symptoms impact daily life and (iii) commonly <lb/>required treatments. <lb/>Two expert clinicians (one paediatric specialist) provided <lb/>written feedback on the vignettes. Revised vignettes were <lb/>sent to eight patients with seasonal ARC and the associ-<lb/>ated health conditions (four patients with seasonal and/or <lb/>perennial ARC/AR and four patients with seasonal and/or <lb/>perennial ARC/AR and asthma), for a second review. Final <lb/>vignettes were developed incorporating all feedback. <lb/>Elicitation methods <lb/>The study task differed for the adult and child surveys. <lb/>A standard gamble (SG) task was designed for the adult <lb/>survey. SG tasks are the only technique that truly reflects <lb/>decisions under uncertainty, thereby mimicking the circum-<lb/>stances under which we make health decisions in real life <lb/>and meeting assumptions of expected utility theory. Due to <lb/>comprehension issues within the child sample age range <lb/>[14] and the use of a comparator of &apos;death&apos;, the SG was not <lb/>considered appropriate for the child survey. Instead, a visual <lb/>analogue scale (VAS) was designed for the child study. <lb/>SG tasks present respondents with a health state <lb/>description, asking them to imagine they experience the <lb/>symptoms described. Respondents must then decide at <lb/>what probability they would decide in favour of a risky <lb/>treatment in order to be cured, with a risk of death should <lb/>the treatment fail, or whether, instead, to remain in the <lb/>certain health state (i.e. unwilling to go ahead with risky <lb/>treatment, instead preferring to continue to experience all <lb/>the symptoms described). The probability of treatment <lb/></body>

			<body>success vs. failure that respondents would be willing to <lb/>accept corresponds to the health utility. For each health <lb/>state, SG items were developed, asking respondents to <lb/>indicate their minimum &apos;acceptable&apos; probability using a <lb/>slider. <lb/>Vignettes designed for adults were adapted for lower <lb/>reading ages, describing the symptoms that, for example, <lb/>&apos;Alex&apos; was feeling, to make them concrete. A VAS ques-<lb/>tion and scale followed, asking children to estimate how <lb/>well they thought that &apos;Alex&apos; was feeling on a scale of <lb/>0-100, where 0 is the worst they think anyone could pos-<lb/>sibly feel, and 100 is the best they think anyone could <lb/>possibly feel. They were presented with a graphical slider <lb/>with images of happy and sad faces at the relevant ends <lb/>for context. <lb/>Survey <lb/>Surveys were developed using the Qualtrics online sur-<lb/>vey platform. Part one recorded demographic information <lb/>and the remaining items comprised 8 of the 14 SG/VAS <lb/>items per respondent (to maintain an acceptable respondent <lb/>burden), randomised with even presentation using the in-<lb/>built algorithm on the Qualtrics platform. The surveys took <lb/>approximately 10 min to complete. <lb/>Following finalisation of the UK version of the surveys, <lb/>survey text was translated by specialist health translators <lb/>(TransPerfect Translations) into French, Slovakian and Ger-<lb/>man. This process comprised forward and backward transla-<lb/>tions, followed by resolution processes to reconcile any dif-<lb/>ferences and ensure conceptual equivalence in all languages. <lb/>Table 1 Health states <lb/>a Assumes that during the pollen season, comorbid perennial allergy symptoms are combined with ARC symptoms and do not require additional <lb/>health states <lb/>b Assumes that utility would be normal in patients with seasonal ARC and no comorbidities regardless of severity <lb/>During the Pollen season <lb/>Health state for elicitation <lb/>Diagnosis <lb/>ARC severity <lb/>(seasonal aller-<lb/>gies) <lb/>Severity of comorbid asthma Presence of comor-<lb/>bid perennial allergic <lb/>rhinitis? <lb/>1 Seasonal ARC <lb/>Mild <lb/>-<lb/>n/a a <lb/>Mild ARC <lb/>2 Seasonal ARC <lb/>Moderate <lb/>-<lb/>n/a a <lb/>Moderate ARC <lb/>3 Seasonal ARC <lb/>Severe <lb/>-<lb/>n/a a <lb/>Severe ARC <lb/>4 Seasonal ARC with asthma <lb/>Mild <lb/>Well-to-partly controlled <lb/>n/a a <lb/>Mild ARC + well-to-partly <lb/>controlled asthma <lb/>5 Seasonal ARC with asthma <lb/>Mild <lb/>Uncontrolled <lb/>n/a a <lb/>Mild ARC + uncontrolled <lb/>asthma <lb/>6 Seasonal ARC with asthma <lb/>Moderate <lb/>Well-to-partly controlled <lb/>n/a a <lb/>Moderate ARC + well-to-partly <lb/>controlled asthma <lb/>7 Seasonal ARC with asthma <lb/>Moderate <lb/>Uncontrolled <lb/>n/a a <lb/>Moderate ARC + uncontrolled <lb/>asthma <lb/>8 Seasonal ARC with asthma <lb/>Severe <lb/>Well-to-partly controlled <lb/>n/a a <lb/>Severe ARC + well-to-partly <lb/>controlled asthma <lb/>9 Seasonal ARC with asthma <lb/>Severe <lb/>Uncontrolled <lb/>n/a a <lb/>Severe ARC + uncontrolled <lb/>asthma <lb/>Outside the Pollen season <lb/>Health state for elicitation <lb/>Diagnosis <lb/>ARC severity <lb/>(seasonal aller-<lb/>gies)b <lb/>Severity of comorbid asthma Presence of comor-<lb/>bid perennial allergic <lb/>rhinitis? <lb/>10 Seasonal ARC and perennial <lb/>AR <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>Yes <lb/>Perennial AR <lb/>11 Seasonal ARC with asthma <lb/>-<lb/>Well-to-partly controlled <lb/>-<lb/>Well-to-partly controlled <lb/>asthma <lb/>12 Seasonal ARC with asthma <lb/>-<lb/>Uncontrolled <lb/>-<lb/>Uncontrolled asthma <lb/>13 Seasonal ARC and perennial <lb/>AR with asthma <lb/>-<lb/>Well-to-partly controlled <lb/>Yes <lb/>Perennial AR + well-to-<lb/>partly controlled asthma <lb/>14 Seasonal ARC and perennial <lb/>AR with asthma <lb/>-<lb/>Uncontrolled <lb/>Yes <lb/>Perennial AR + uncon-<lb/>trolled asthma <lb/></body>

			<body>Translations were migrated to the online platform, where <lb/>data were collected into a single database for adults, and a <lb/>single database for children, regardless of the language of <lb/>completion. <lb/>The sample was recruited by a third party (Qualtrics) <lb/>which maintains online panel respondents who are invited <lb/>to participate in online surveys in exchange for electronic <lb/>points. The adult sample was selected to be broadly rep-<lb/>resentative of the adult general population in each of the <lb/>four countries (UK, France, Germany and Slovakia). Res-<lb/>idents of these countries over the age of 18 years with <lb/>and without ARC and associated conditions were eligi-<lb/>ble. To achieve a representative sample, quotas were set <lb/>based on age and gender (Table 2). When these quotas <lb/>were full, respondents meeting criteria for full quotas were <lb/>no longer eligible. Recruitment was ongoing until 350 <lb/>complete responses were received per country, ensuring <lb/>at least 200 responses per health state. The child sample <lb/>comprised children aged 8-11 years, with the upper limit <lb/>reflecting the age at which child-specific drug labelling <lb/>changes (12 years), and the lower limit based on evidence <lb/>on the minimum age (8 years) for task comprehension <lb/>[14]. Due to the narrow age range, the sample was strati-<lb/>fied by gender only. Residents in the UK, France, Germany <lb/>or Slovakia aged 8-11 were eligible. As with the adult <lb/>sample, quotas were used to achieve sample stratification, <lb/>and respondents meeting criteria for full quotas were no <lb/>longer eligible (Table 2). Recruitment was ongoing until <lb/>260 (fewer than adults due to difficulty reaching respond-<lb/>ents in this age group) complete responses were received <lb/>per country, ensuring at least 150 responses per health <lb/>state. <lb/>Following email invitation, respondents completed <lb/>the survey online. Survey invites for the children were <lb/>sent to parents to ensure informed parental consent. Adult <lb/>respondents and consenting parents of child respondents <lb/>completed the pre-screening demographic questions to <lb/>ensure that only those who met eligibility criteria were <lb/>directed to complete the full survey. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Data were exported into SPSS (v24.0) for statistical analy-<lb/>sis. Descriptive statistics detailing the socio-demographic <lb/>data for the sample (e.g. gender, age, employment status) <lb/>were generated. <lb/>Extreme values, or those that lacked face validity, were <lb/>removed where appropriate. All exclusion rules applied <lb/>are described at each analysis. Average values (mean and <lb/>median) for utilities and disutilities were calculated from <lb/>the respondent-level data. Analyses of variance (ANO-<lb/>VAs) were conducted to investigate differences between <lb/>utilities and disutilities generated by patient and non-<lb/>patient populations for the relevant health states (i.e. those <lb/>involving only that patient group). &apos;Patients&apos; were defined <lb/>as any respondent who self-reported either current or pre-<lb/>vious diagnosis of asthma, allergic rhinitis or hay fever. <lb/>Where violations of ANOVA assumptions were identified, <lb/>appropriate alternatives are reported (e.g. Brown-Forsythe <lb/>F statistics). <lb/>Results <lb/>Study population <lb/>A total of 1454 adults (UK: 362, France: 368, Germany: <lb/>359, Slovakia: 365) and 1082 children (UK: 263, France: <lb/>273, Slovakia: 273, Germany: 273) completed the survey. <lb/>For each country, the age and gender sample stratifications <lb/>broadly met the target criteria to generate samples repre-<lb/>sentative of the general population in each country (see <lb/>Supplementary Material for target and actual demograph-<lb/>ics per country). Table 2 shows that there were high levels <lb/>of adults self-reporting previously experiencing ARC, with <lb/>fewer respondents self-reporting other diagnoses. Rates of <lb/>relevant diagnoses were higher still in children, with 55% <lb/>parents reporting that their child had experienced ARC. <lb/>Table 2 Sample characteristics <lb/>a Targets represent averaged country-specific demographic weight-<lb/>ings derived from Eurostat 2015 data.

			<body>Utilities <lb/>Examination of box-and-whisker plots indicated that adult <lb/>utilities lower than 0.3 were statistical outliers (&gt; 1.5 inter-<lb/>quartile ranges below the lower quartile). These values were <lb/>also considered to be lacking face validity, and indicative of <lb/>respondents not responding in a thoughtful manner or having <lb/>misunderstood the question. The child data included greater <lb/>numbers of low utility values, and those lower than 0.3 were <lb/>not outliers according to the interquartile range (IQR) rule <lb/>(greater than 1.5 × IQR above the upper or below the lower <lb/>quartile); however, values below this level were still consid-<lb/>ered to be lacking face validity and thus, for both datasets, <lb/>responses for individuals who produced ratings lower than <lb/>0.3 for any health state were removed. This resulted in inclu-<lb/>sion of 1235 adults (exclusions per country: UK: 54; France: <lb/>55; Germany: 53; Slovakia: 57) and 423 children (exclu-<lb/>sions per country: UK: 133; France: 151; Germany: 166; <lb/>Slovakia: 209). The impact of different exclusion criteria on <lb/>sample size and utility estimates was examined in sensitivity <lb/>analyses (see Supplementary Material B). Average utilities <lb/>obtained are shown in Table 3. <lb/>Results were largely consistent with expectations, <lb/>whereby more severe health states were valued lowest, and <lb/>milder health states were valued higher. However, paradoxi-<lb/>cal findings were observed in that for both severe ARC and <lb/>perennial AR, health utilities were rated lower than for the <lb/>same condition with comorbid well-to-partly controlled <lb/>asthma. The small differences here indicate little differen-<lb/>tiation between the comorbid and isolated cases of these <lb/>conditions on an aggregate level, likely a consequence of <lb/>only a sub-sample having rated both conditions. <lb/>Utilities rated by children were substantially lower than <lb/>those rated by adults for all health states. As in the adult <lb/>population, results were largely consistent with expectations <lb/>with more severe health states valued lowest, and milder <lb/>health states valued higher. Again, there were some slight <lb/>inconsistencies; utility for uncontrolled asthma alone was <lb/>rated as slightly poorer than for uncontrolled asthma comor-<lb/>bid with perennial AR, mild ARC or moderate ARC. Such <lb/>issues are considered in the calculation of disutilities, which <lb/>were calculated at the respondent level between respondents <lb/>who rated both of the health states. <lb/>One-way ANOVAs demonstrated that most utility esti-<lb/>mates did not change significantly whether rated by patients <lb/>or non-patients with the exception that adult utilities for <lb/>perennial AR were rated significantly lower by adults self-<lb/>reporting allergic rhinitis experience (0.817) than those not <lb/>(0.849; p = .042). <lb/>Disutilities <lb/>Disutilities were calculated at the respondent level, and then <lb/>averaged across the samples, excluding any respondents who <lb/>valued less severe health states as lower than more severe <lb/>health states. Disutilities were generally highest for changes <lb/>between the mildest and most severe health states, and for <lb/>relative differences between isolated health states and those <lb/>with uncontrolled asthma (Table 4). <lb/>Table 3 Average adult and child utilities <lb/>SE standard error of the mean, IQR interquartile range <lb/>No. Health state <lb/>Utilities <lb/>Adult <lb/>Child <lb/>N <lb/>Mean (SE) <lb/>Median (IQR) <lb/>N <lb/>Mean (SE) <lb/>Median (IQR) <lb/>1 <lb/>Well-to-partly controlled asthma <lb/>709 0.874 (0.006) 0.949 (0.800-0.993) 232 0.693 (0.011) 0.700 (0.560-0.820) <lb/>2 <lb/>Uncontrolled asthma <lb/>710 0.829 (0.006) 0.884 (0.737-0.952) 227 0.635 (0.012) 0.620 (0.500-0.770) <lb/>3 <lb/>Mild ARC <lb/>714 0.880 (0.006) 0.967 (0.804-0.996) 252 0.705 (0.011) 0.700 (0.590-0.850) <lb/>4 <lb/>Mild ARC + well-to-partly controlled asthma <lb/>700 0.872 (0.006) 0.947 (0.800-0.993) 253 0.677 (0.010) 0.690 (0.540-0.790) <lb/>5 <lb/>Mild ARC + uncontrolled asthma <lb/>714 0.844 (0.006) 0.900 (0.754-0.980) 250 0.643 (0.010) 0.640 (0.510-0.753) <lb/>6 <lb/>Moderate ARC <lb/>709 0.864 (0.006) 0.901 (0.799-0.986) 249 0.675 (0.010) 0.680 (0.550-0.800) <lb/>7 <lb/>Moderate ARC + well-to-partly controlled asthma 688 0.847 (0.006) 0.900 (0.775-0.981) 252 0.668 (0.010) 0.660 (0.560-0.780) <lb/>8 <lb/>Moderate ARC + uncontrolled asthma <lb/>711 0.828 (0.006) 0.886 (0.745-0.962) 240 0.647 (0.011) 0.635 (0.510-0.788) <lb/>9 <lb/>Severe ARC <lb/>707 0.831 (0.006) 0.888 (0.733-0.973) 223 0.666 (0.011) 0.660 (0.550-0.780) <lb/>10 Severe ARC + well-to-partly controlled asthma <lb/>718 0.845 (0.006) 0.900 (0.774-0.981) 243 0.663 (0.010) 0.660 (0.520-0.790) <lb/>11 Severe ARC + uncontrolled asthma <lb/>712 0.812 (0.006) 0.851 (0.708-0.948) 223 0.635 (0.011) 0.610 (0.500-0.760) <lb/>12 Perennial AR <lb/>697 0.842 (0.006) 0.899 (0.763-0.977) 247 0.655 (0.010) 0.650 (0.520-0.770) <lb/>13 Perennial AR + well-to-partly controlled asthma <lb/>694 0.849 (0.006) 0.900 (0.790-0.979) 248 0.650 (0.010) 0.650 (0.520-0.750) <lb/>14 Perennial AR + uncontrolled asthma <lb/>697 0.818 (0.006) 0.852 (0.709-0.960) 245 0.638 (0.012) 0.630 (0.500-0.790) <lb/></body>

			<body>One-way ANOVAs revealed that, for the most part, disu-<lb/>tilities did not differ significantly between patients and non-<lb/>patients (and as such, are not reported separately), with only <lb/>child disutilities comparing moderate and severe ARC that <lb/>were significantly larger in children whose parents reported <lb/>that they have suffered with seasonal ARC (0.135) compared <lb/>with those children with no parent-reported seasonal ARC <lb/>(0.073; p = .020). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The utilities and disutilities generated in this study demon-<lb/>strate how living with ARC and associated health conditions <lb/>impacts HRQoL. In particular, the disutilities calculated <lb/>indicate how increases in severity and morbidity reduce <lb/>HRQoL, with the largest disutilities observed between the <lb/>mild and severe forms of ARC and between isolated ARC <lb/>and ARC with comorbid uncontrolled asthma. <lb/>Mean utilities generated for symptoms of ARC during <lb/>pollen season were between 0.831 (severe) and 0.880 (mild; <lb/>medians 0.888-0.967) in adult populations, and lower still <lb/>in paediatric populations, at between 0.666 (severe) and <lb/>0.705 (mild; medians 0.600-0.700). These adult values sit <lb/>between those reported in other published literature. EQ-<lb/>5D-3L trial data published in Poole et al. [15] reported peak <lb/>season utility values of 0.888-0.947 in patients with mod-<lb/>erate-to-severe grass pollen allergies, closer to the median <lb/>values elicited in the current study than the mean values. <lb/>Conversely, Petersen et al. [16] reported EQ-5D-3L utili-<lb/>ties for symptomatic ARC that were much lower than those <lb/>observed in the current study, at 0.70 for individuals with <lb/>ARC and 0.72 for those with ARC and comorbid perennial <lb/>AR. It should be noted that the trial population in Petersen <lb/>et al. [16] included approximately 50% patients with comor-<lb/>bid asthma, which may have influenced the lower utility <lb/>reported, however, the paper did not report utilities separated <lb/>by presence of comorbidity. Given the absence of previously <lb/>published paediatric estimates, it remains unclear whether <lb/>the difference in magnitude of values elicited by adults and <lb/>children reflects true differences in priorities. The possibility <lb/>that they result from either methodological differences or the <lb/>difficulties of conducting such studies in child populations <lb/>is discussed in the Limitations section. <lb/>To our knowledge, no published studies have previously <lb/>reported utilities for ARC with comorbid asthma. The mag-<lb/>nitude of adult utility values in the present study for seasonal <lb/>ARC conditions with comorbid asthma was lower than in <lb/>those with no comorbidities, at between 0.812 and 0.872 <lb/>(medians 0.851-0.947). Disutilities were calculated at the <lb/>respondent level, between individuals presented with both <lb/>the single and comorbid health states in question. Adults <lb/>estimated a utility decrement of 0.048-0.070 (depending on <lb/>the severity of each morbidity) associated with the presence <lb/>of asthma alongside ARC. Again, the utility estimates gen-<lb/>erated by paediatric populations were considerably lower, <lb/>Table 4 Average adult and child disutilities <lb/>SEM standard error of the mean, IQR interquartile range <lb/>Adult <lb/>Child <lb/>N <lb/>Mean (SE) <lb/>Median (IQR) <lb/>N <lb/>Mean (SE) <lb/>Median (IQR) <lb/>Impact of increased severity <lb/>Mild ARC <lb/>Moderate ARC <lb/>277 <lb/>0.054 (0.005) <lb/>0.019 (0.002-0.081) <lb/>93 <lb/>0.131 (0.013) <lb/>0.100 (0.030-0.205) <lb/>Severe ARC <lb/>283 <lb/>0.085 (0.006) <lb/>0.047 (0.007-0.117) <lb/>69 <lb/>0.121 (0.015) <lb/>0.090 (0.020-0.175) <lb/>Moderate ARC <lb/>Severe ARC <lb/>251 <lb/>0.065 (0.005) <lb/>0.030 (0.003-0.098) <lb/>74 <lb/>0.101 (0.013) <lb/>0.065 (0.010-0.153) <lb/>Well-to-partly controlled asthma <lb/>Uncontrolled asthma <lb/>293 <lb/>0.091 (0.006) <lb/>0.057 (0.011-0.118) <lb/>67 <lb/>0.155 (0.020) <lb/>0.090 (0.030-0.240) <lb/>Impact of comorbidity <lb/>Mild ARC <lb/>+ Well-to-partly controlled asthma <lb/>231 <lb/>0.048 (0.006) <lb/>0.011 (0.001-0.058) <lb/>93 <lb/>0.089 (0.008) <lb/>0.070 (0.025-0.140) <lb/>+ Uncontrolled asthma <lb/>272 <lb/>0.070 (0.005) <lb/>0.040 (0.005-0.101) <lb/>87 <lb/>0.172 (0.017) <lb/>0.130 (0.030-0.290) <lb/>Moderate ARC <lb/>+ Well-to-partly controlled asthma <lb/>216 <lb/>0.058 (0.006) <lb/>0.017 (0.000-0.087) <lb/>81 <lb/>0.098 (0.011) <lb/>0.070 (0.020-0.130) <lb/>+ Uncontrolled asthma <lb/>291 <lb/>0.067 (0.005) <lb/>0.033 (0.004-0.101) <lb/>86 <lb/>0.116 (0.012) <lb/>0.090 (0.020-0.180) <lb/>Severe ARC <lb/>+ Well-to-partly controlled asthma <lb/>229 <lb/>0.053 (0.006) <lb/>0.013 (0.003-0.071) <lb/>69 <lb/>0.094 (0.013) <lb/>0.070 (0.010-0.125) <lb/>+ Uncontrolled asthma <lb/>245 <lb/>0.065 (0.005) <lb/>0.037 (0.004-0.100) <lb/>74 <lb/>0.104 (0.011) <lb/>0.090 (0.020-0.153) <lb/></body>

			<body>1 3 <lb/>while disutilities were higher, a pattern that was observed <lb/>across the board. <lb/>Finally, utility estimates elicited for asthma in isolation <lb/>were broadly in line with the limited data available, such as <lb/>Briggs et al. [17], which reports mapped utility values of <lb/>0.857 for well-controlled asthma and 0.798 for &apos;not well-<lb/>controlled asthma&apos;. The current study found mean adult-gen-<lb/>erated asthma utility values to be at 0.829 (median 0.884) for <lb/>uncontrolled asthma, and 0.874 (median 0.949) for well-to-<lb/>partly controlled asthma. Mean child-generated utilities were <lb/>lower, at 0.635 (median 0.620) for uncontrolled asthma, and <lb/>0.693 (median 0.700) for well-to-partly controlled asthma. <lb/>Clinical meaningfulness <lb/>There are no established minimally important differences <lb/>for SG-elicited or VAS-elicited utility in this health area; <lb/>however, using the average minimally important differ-<lb/>ences estimated for the EQ-5D and SF-6D -elicited utilities <lb/>as a guide (SF-6D: 0.04; EQ-5D: 0.07; Walters and Brazier <lb/>[18]), the disutility associated with increases in severity <lb/>of ARC or comorbidity would be considered to represent <lb/>clinically meaningful drops in HRQoL. The lowest disutil-<lb/>ity observed for the adult sample was 0.048 (the impact of <lb/>comorbid well-to-partly controlled asthma on mild ARC), <lb/>up to 0.091, while those for children varied between 0.089 <lb/>(median 0.065) and 0.172 (median 0.130). <lb/>Moreover, comparison with a US study that generated <lb/>EQ-5D-3L utility values for a wide variety of chronic condi-<lb/>tions [19] indicates that values of 0.831-0.880 elicited for <lb/>ARC in the current study by adults are in line with their <lb/>values of 0.853 for allergic rhinitis and 0.853 for chronic <lb/>sinusitis, similar conditions to ARC. Relative to less similar <lb/>chronic conditions with utilities in this range, comparison <lb/>of values suggests that ARC impacts HRQoL to a similar <lb/>level as psoriasis (0.834), benign breast disease (0.852) and <lb/>urinary calculi (calcium stones in the urinary tract; 0.838). <lb/>The adult values elicited for ARC conditions with comor-<lb/>bid asthma in the current study were as low as 0.812, cor-<lb/>responding closely with the EQ-5D-3L utilities elicited in <lb/>Sullivan and Ghushchyan [19] for respiratory system dis-<lb/>eases (0.816) and suggesting a similar impact on HRQoL to <lb/>chronic conditions such as malignant skin growths (0.812), <lb/>menopausal disorders (0.817) and urinary tract disorders <lb/>(0.826). <lb/>Health economic modelling <lb/>CUA uses the concept of health utility, rather than HRQoL <lb/>per se, or another measure of clinical effectiveness, in order <lb/>to weight the value of the impact on HRQoL to reflect the <lb/>value attributed to that impact by a particular population, <lb/>commonly the general public. The current study generated <lb/>sets of values from both adult and child populations, and <lb/>thus provides a source of utilities that aim to reflect the pri-<lb/>orities and preferences of the paediatric population in addi-<lb/>tion to adults. Given that parents may not accurately perceive <lb/>even their own child&apos;s HRQoL [13], the paediatric values <lb/>generated here may be a more accurate reflection of the ways <lb/>in which the symptoms associated with ARC and asthma <lb/>impact a child&apos;s life, and the value that such impacts hold <lb/>for children. However, as always within economic model-<lb/>ling, sensitivity and scenario analyses should be conducted <lb/>to assess the uncertainty within the model and the impact of <lb/>using alternative utility and disutility estimates. <lb/>This study has generated values for a wide range of health <lb/>states; however, modelling requirements may, in some cases, <lb/>require aggregation of two or more health states, for exam-<lb/>ple, the estimation of an overall utility value for asthma. In <lb/>such cases, averages should be weighted by the proportion <lb/>of the population to which each respective health state would <lb/>apply. <lb/>The study sample included large numbers of respondents <lb/>self-reporting suffering with ARC, and associated condi-<lb/>tions, highlighting the widespread nature of the diseases. <lb/>Estimates between patients and non-patients were very simi-<lb/>lar. Given the volume of individuals reporting experience <lb/>with these conditions in the general population (and, cor-<lb/>respondingly, the large proportion of the general population <lb/>that would be excluded in samples excluding patient groups) <lb/>and that patient status made few differences, utilities elicited <lb/>from a general population sample including both patients <lb/>and non-patients (as recruited in the current study) would <lb/>likely be most reflective of the societal value of each health <lb/>state. <lb/>Limitations <lb/>In the SG task, there was a large range in the level of risk <lb/>that some adult respondents indicated they were willing to <lb/>accept, with some individuals suggesting they would will-<lb/>ingly accept 100% risk of death for a treatment which had <lb/>0% chance of improving their health state. It is likely that, <lb/>for some adult respondents, there was some confusion about <lb/>the nature of the task and the ratings that they were making, <lb/>and that for others, they were simply completing the task <lb/>as quickly as possible and not giving the necessary con-<lb/>sideration to the task at hand. Moreover, the complexity of <lb/>some of the comorbid symptom profiles may have led to <lb/>some respondents not absorbing all aspects of the conditions <lb/>described. In particular, utility differences between ARC and <lb/>well-to-partly controlled asthma compared with ARC alone <lb/>were not very pronounced considering the differences in <lb/>the conditions described, and it is possible that features of <lb/>asthma were not attended to. <lb/></body>

			<body>Similarly large ranges were observed in the child VAS <lb/>data, and in general utility values elicited in children were <lb/>much lower than those elicited in adults. It is likely that <lb/>children, with less experience or knowledge of the vast <lb/>array of health conditions that people can suffer from, <lb/>struggle to understand the scaling and, therefore, all esti-<lb/>mates for these health states were scaled down. Alterna-<lb/>tively, differences in the scores may be an artefact of using <lb/>different tasks in the adults and children, and indeed previ-<lb/>ous research has demonstrated elicitation of higher values <lb/>using SG methodology compared with VAS [20, 21]. <lb/>Exclusion of responses lower than 0.3 is likely to have <lb/>removed a large proportion of unthoughtful or confused <lb/>respondents, and randomisation of the order of health <lb/>state presentation across participants aimed to reduce <lb/>order effects, however, these issues may explain some of <lb/>the inconsistencies observed. Application of this exclu-<lb/>sion rule resulted in the exclusion of 659 children and <lb/>219 adults, indicating that a substantial number of chil-<lb/>dren in particular, were providing responses that lacked <lb/>face validity, and highlighting the difficulties of conduct-<lb/>ing such studies in child populations. Sensitivity analyses <lb/>exploring the impact of using different exclusion criteria <lb/>are reported in Supplementary Material B, and conclude <lb/>that these criteria produced the best balance of includ-<lb/>ing maximal respondents while excluding the majority of <lb/>substandard data. <lb/>In both the adult and child data, there were some small <lb/>differences in directions against expectations, however, <lb/>such differences would not be considered statistically dif-<lb/>ferent, and likely result from the fact that patients were <lb/>allocated a random 8 of the total 14 health states, there-<lb/>fore were not considering all conditions relative to one <lb/>another. Calculation of disutilities was conducted using <lb/>respondent-level data including only respondents who <lb/>had been presented with the two health states in question, <lb/>rather than at the aggregate level, in order to present more <lb/>consistent disutilities from individuals who had had the <lb/>opportunity to consider both states in question. <lb/>Electronic administration is beneficial for allowing <lb/>fast collection of data from large samples, but, inevitably, <lb/>some of the nuances that occur in an interview setting are <lb/>lost. For example, individuals are likely to be less inclined <lb/>to reflect on their decision, while this may be encouraged <lb/>in an interview setting. Vignette studies are also limited in <lb/>that when asked to imagine they have an illness, partici-<lb/>pants often imagine the impact of the illness at the time <lb/>immediately following diagnosis, and respond to questions <lb/>accordingly, whereas patients often grow accustomed to <lb/>living with a condition and although their health utility <lb/>may be lower at disease onset, it commonly improves as <lb/>patients get used to the condition. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>This study provides utility and disutility values that can <lb/>be used in health economic models of new treatments for <lb/>AR/ARC and asthma. The disutility values calculated dem-<lb/>onstrate how increases in severity and morbidity reduce <lb/>HRQoL, and these findings, alongside research into other <lb/>chronic conditions, converge to emphasise that the impact <lb/>of ARC and associated conditions on patient HRQoL should <lb/>not be dismissed as inconsequential, and that treatments that <lb/>reduce symptom severity and risk of asthma onset are likely <lb/>to provide clinically meaningful utility gains. <lb/></body>
