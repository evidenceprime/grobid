			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>In a recent 2-year cancer bioassay conducted by the National <lb/>Toxicology Program (NTP), hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] adminis-<lb/>tered in drinking water induced small intestinal tumors in B6C3F1 <lb/>mice, and tumors of the oral cavity in Fisher 344 rats; no other <lb/>treatment-related tumors were reported in either species (NTP, <lb/>2008b; Stout et al., 2009a). In the small intestine, there were clear <lb/>differences between mice and rats with respect to non-neoplastic <lb/>lesions (NTP, 2008b). The mode of action (MOA) for the intestinal <lb/>tumors is posited to involve chronic intestinal injury leading to <lb/>long-term intestinal regenerative hyperplasia (Thompson et al., <lb/>2013). In contrast to the intestine, the oral mucosae of mice and <lb/>rats exhibited no non-neoplastic or pre-neoplastic lesions; and to <lb/>date, there is no published MOA describing Cr(VI)-induced oral <lb/>tumors in rats. <lb/>As part of our research on the toxicity and carcinogenicity of <lb/>Cr(VI) by the oral route of exposure (Kirman et al., 2012; Kopec <lb/>et al., 2012a,b; Proctor et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2011, 2012), <lb/>we collected data to follow up on previous reports that Cr(VI) <lb/>causes microcytic hypochromic anemia (NTP, 1996, 1997, 2007, <lb/>2008b). In the 90-day NTP study with drinking water concentra-<lb/>tions of $22-300 mg/L Cr(VI), microcytic hypochromic anemia <lb/>was observed in rats and mice; anemia was reported to be more se-<lb/>vere in rats than mice, but no significant sex differences in hema-<lb/>tological effects were reported (NTP, 2007). In the 2-year bioassay, <lb/>NTP reported hematological effects (including hemoglobin, mean <lb/>cell volume, erythrocytes) in male rats and female mice at multiple <lb/>time points, which NTP concluded were more severe and pro-<lb/>longed in rats than mice (Supplemental Fig. S1) (NTP, 2008b). Be-<lb/>cause female rats and male mice were not evaluated, sex <lb/>differences in regard to hematological effects could not be assessed <lb/>in the 2-year NTP bioassay. The anemia did ameliorate with time, <lb/>but significant changes in some hematological markers were still <lb/></body>

			<body>evident in the high dose group rats at one year, which was the final <lb/>time point at which hematology was evaluated in the 2-year NTP <lb/>bioassay. <lb/>These anemic responses to high concentrations of Cr(VI) sug-<lb/>gest interference with iron (Fe) absorption and/or homeostasis. In <lb/>this regard, it is known that Cr(VI), Cr(V), and Cr(IV) can oxidize <lb/>ferrous iron (Fe 2+ ) to ferric iron (Fe 3+ ) (Buerge and Hug, 1997; <lb/>Fendorf and Li, 1996): <lb/>CrðVIÞ þ Fe 2þ $ CrðVÞ þ Fe 3þ <lb/>ðiÞ <lb/>CrðVÞ þ Fe 2þ $ CrðIVÞ þ Fe 3þ <lb/>ðiiÞ <lb/>CrðIVÞ þ Fe 2þ $ CrðIIIÞ þ Fe 3þ <lb/>ðiiiÞ <lb/>Further, it is well established that the major form of non-heme <lb/>dietary iron is Fe 3+ , which must be reduced to Fe 2+ prior to absorp-<lb/>tion by enterocytes in the proximal small intestine (Kumar et al., <lb/>2005; Lonnerdal, 2010). Therefore, we hypothesize that high con-<lb/>centrations of ingested Cr(VI) may oxidize Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ and hinder <lb/>Fe 2+ absorption from the intestinal lumen. Notably, anemic effects <lb/>were not observed in rodents chronically exposed to trivalent chro-<lb/>mium [Cr(III)] (NTP, 2008a; Stout et al., 2009b)-further suggesting <lb/>that the chemistry in formulas i, ii, iii may, at least partially, ex-<lb/>plain the anemic effects of Cr(VI). <lb/>In addition to this extracellular chemistry, Cr(VI) absorbed to <lb/>the bloodstream may be taken up into red blood cells (RBCs) and <lb/>reduced to Cr(III). Once inside the cell, Cr(III) can bind to ferritin <lb/>in competition with intracellular Fe (Ani and Moshtaghie, 1992; <lb/>Wauters et al., 1978). In contrast, Cr(III) from extracellular reduc-<lb/>tion of Cr(VI) in the blood does not readily cross the RBC mem-<lb/>brane and is thus free to compete with Fe binding to transferrin <lb/>(Ducros, 1992; Hopkins and Schwarz, 1964; Sayato et al., 1980). <lb/>Once Cr(VI) is absorbed into the RBCs, Cr(III) is produced from <lb/>intracellular reduction of Cr(VI), and becomes trapped in the RBC, <lb/>increasing the total Cr RBC:plasma ratio. As such, there are several <lb/>ways in which high doses of Cr(VI) can cause disruption Fe metab-<lb/>olism and homeostasis. <lb/>Iron plays an important role in many metabolic pathways be-<lb/>cause it is a functional component of oxygen-carrying globin pro-<lb/>teins including hemoglobin and myoglobin, cytochromes, and <lb/>enzymes that transfer electrons (Andrews and Schmidt, 2007; <lb/>Recalcati et al., 2012). Further, Fe is used for DNA synthesis and en-<lb/>ergy production, and as such, Fe homeostasis is tightly controlled <lb/>to ensure coordinated absorption by enterocytes, reutilization in <lb/>the macrophages, and proper distribution for erythropoiesis or <lb/>storage in hepatocytes (Andrews and Schmidt, 2007; Recalcati <lb/>et al., 2012). Iron is also an essential element for proper function <lb/>of the immune system; in fact, macrophages sequester Fe by differ-<lb/>ent mechanisms to contain microbial infection (Huang, 2003; <lb/>Recalcati et al., 2012). It has also been suggested that disruption <lb/>of Fe metabolism can potentiate oral carcinogenicity (Binnie <lb/>et al., 1983; Prime et al., 1983; Rennie et al., 1984; Richie et al., <lb/>2008). Given the importance of Fe in basic physiological processes, <lb/>disruption of Fe status and homeostasis could play a role in several <lb/>of the adverse outcomes observed with high dose Cr(VI) exposure. <lb/>Recently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency <lb/>(U.S. EPA) released drinking water supply monitoring data for its <lb/>third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR3) pro-<lb/>gram; Cr(VI) was detected in 5260 drinking water samples, of <lb/>6929 samples analyzed, at concentrations ranging from <lb/>0.00003 mg/L, the minimal reporting level, to 0.091 mg/L, with <lb/>mean and median values of 0.0014 and 0.00019 mg/L, respectively <lb/>(USEPA, 2013). Thus, drinking water exposures to Cr(VI) in humans <lb/>are several orders of magnitude lower than those that disrupted Fe <lb/>absorption and homeostasis in rodents of the NTP bioassays (NTP, <lb/>2007, 2008b; Stout et al., 2009a). <lb/>Herein we evaluate the biochemical and toxicogenomic evi-<lb/>dence that Cr(VI) disrupts Fe absorption and homeostasis, as well <lb/>as evaluate pharmacokinetic data to assess dose-dependent transi-<lb/>tions in chromium disposition. This study extends our previous <lb/>analyses (Kopec et al., 2012a,b; Thompson et al., 2011, 2012) which <lb/>described the effects of 7 and 90 days of exposure to Cr(VI) on gene <lb/>expression in the duodena of rats and mice (Kopec et al., 2012a,b). <lb/>Because most dietary Fe is absorbed in the proximal small intestine <lb/>and Fe homeostasis is regulated at the level of intestinal absorption <lb/>(Kumar et al., 2005; Lonnerdal, 2010; Wood and Han, 1998), toxic-<lb/>ogenomic data from the duodenum are useful for assessing Fe <lb/>homeostasis. <lb/>2. Material and methods <lb/>2.1. Animal husbandry and study design <lb/>Details of the test substance, animal husbandry, and study design have been de-<lb/>scribed previously (Thompson et al., 2011, 2012). Briefly, Southern Research Insti-<lb/>tute (Birmingham, AL) acclimatized 4-5 week old female Fischer F344 rats and <lb/>female B6C3F1 mice (Charles Rivers Laboratories International, Stone Ridge, NY) <lb/>for a minimum of 7 days with free access to irradiated NTP-2000 wafers (Zeigler <lb/>Bros, Gardners, PA). Animals were continuously exposed to Cr(VI), administered <lb/>as sodium dichromate dihydrate (SDD), dissolved in tap water at 0, 0.3, 4, 14, 60, <lb/>170 and 520 mg/L, corresponding to 0, 0.1, 1.4, 5, 20, 60, and 180 mg/L Cr(VI), for <lb/>7 and 90 days (note: rats were not exposed to 14 mg/L SDD). Based on animal body <lb/>weight, water intake, and administered drinking water concentrations of Cr(VI), 90-<lb/>day average daily doses for rats and mice were calculated (Table 1). Rats and mice <lb/>were euthanized using CO 2 . All procedures were carried out with the approval of <lb/>the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Southern Research Institute. <lb/>2.2. Assessment of Fe levels in serum and bone marrow <lb/>Serum Fe levels were measured in 10 animals from each dose group. Samples <lb/>($0.4 ml) were collected from the retro-orbital plexus into tubes containing no <lb/>anticoagulant. The contents of the tubes were centrifuged to separate serum. Serum <lb/>Fe was measured using the FerroZine method and Cobas c501 Clinical Chemistry <lb/>Analyzer (Version 04-02; Roche Diagnostics; Indianapolis, IN). The Fe content in <lb/>bone marrow smears was also assessed in 5 animals per dose group. Gale scores <lb/>were used as semi-quantitative grading scheme to assess Fe content in bone mar-<lb/>row (Gale et al., 1963). In each dose group, one bone marrow smear from each ani-<lb/>mal was prepared and stained with Prussian blue to assess the presence of Fe. <lb/>Table 1 <lb/>Average daily doses of ingested Cr(VI) for rats and mice administered Cr(VI) as SDD in drinking water for 90 days. <lb/>Administered drinking water concentration, Cr(VI) (mg/L) <lb/>0.1 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>5 <lb/>20 <lb/>60 <lb/>180 <lb/>90-Day average daily dose, Cr(VI) (mg/kg) a <lb/>Rat <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.21 <lb/>-b <lb/>2.90 <lb/>7.20 <lb/>20.5 <lb/>Mouse <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.30 <lb/>1.10 <lb/>4.60 <lb/>11.7 <lb/>31.1 <lb/>a Average daily doses were calculated from animal bodyweight, water intake, and administered drinking water concentrations of Cr(VI).

			<body>2.3. Assessment of Fe and Cr levels in tissues <lb/>Tissue levels of total Cr and Fe were measured in 5 animals per dose group. <lb/>Samples were shipped frozen to Brooks Rand Laboratories where approximately <lb/>100 mg of tissue was digested in nitric acid in a controlled microwave digestion <lb/>program. Samples were then brought to a final volume of 8 mL with deionized <lb/>water. Analysis was performed using EPA Draft Method 1638 (modified) using <lb/>inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with Dynamic Reaction <lb/>Cell (DRC™) technology. Digested samples were analyzed utilizing internal stan-<lb/>dardization with rhodium. This method incorporates ionization of the sample in <lb/>an inductively-coupled RF plasma, with detection of the resulting ions by mass <lb/>spectrometer on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio. Results were presented <lb/>for total Fe in duodenum and liver and total Cr in the RBCs and plasma. The limit <lb/>of detection was 0.02 lg Cr/g tissue. Iron levels were simultaneously measured in <lb/>these tissue samples, and the limit of detection was 0.2 lg Fe/g tissue. <lb/>2.4. Microarray analysis <lb/>For toxicogenomic analyses, duodenal samples were scraped and processed as <lb/>described previously (Kopec et al., 2012a). Briefly, intestinal sections were collected <lb/>and flushed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline. Duodenal sections were cut <lb/>longitudinally and the epithelium was scraped using disposable sterile plastic spat-<lb/>ulas (VWR International) into vials containing $1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, <lb/>CA) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at À80 °C and <lb/>shipped on dry ice to Michigan State University for gene expression analysis. Total <lb/>RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol with an additional acid <lb/>phenol:chloroform extraction. Isolated RNA was resuspended in RNA storage solu-<lb/>tion (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), quantified (A 260 ), and quality of each sample was as-<lb/>sessed by evaluation of the A 260 /A 280 ratio and by visual inspection of 1 lg total RNA <lb/>on a denaturing gel. Gene expression was examined using rat 4 Â 44 K Agilent <lb/>whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays (version 1, Agilent Technologies, Inc., <lb/>Santa Clara, CA). Microarrays were scanned at 532 nm (Cy3) and 635 nm (Cy5) on <lb/>a GenePix 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Images were ana-<lb/>lyzed for feature and background intensities using GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Molec-<lb/>ular Devices). <lb/>2.5. Statistical analyses <lb/>Dose-related trends for tissue concentrations of total Fe were analyzed initially <lb/>using Jonckheere&apos;s test (Jonckheere, 1954). Then, data with a significant dose-re-<lb/>lated trend were analyzed by William&apos;s tests (parametric) or Shirley&apos;s tests (non-<lb/>parametric) (Shirley, 1977). If no monotone trend was observed, Dunnett&apos;s tests <lb/>(parametric) or Dunn&apos;s (nonparametric) tests were conducted. Statistical packages <lb/>used included Prism 5 for Mac (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, <lb/>www.graphpad.com). <lb/>Microarray data were normalized using a semi-parametric approach (Eckel <lb/>et al., 2005) and the posterior probability P1(t) values were calculated using an <lb/>empirical Bayes method based on a per gene and dose basis using model-based t <lb/>values (Eckel et al., 2004). Gene expression data were ranked and prioritized using <lb/>|fold change| &gt; 1.5 and statistical P1(t) value &gt;0.999 criteria to identify differentially <lb/>expressed genes. <lb/>3. Results <lb/>3.1. Effects on iron status <lb/>As shown in Fig. 1, there were dose-dependent decreases of the <lb/>total Fe in the duodenum, liver, and serum of both species. Dose-<lb/>dependent changes in liver and serum were slightly more pro-<lb/>nounced in rats than mice (Fig. 1B and C). We also examined the <lb/>bone marrows for Fe content by Prussian blue staining. Overall, <lb/>there were no changes in Fe content of bone marrows for rats <lb/>administered drinking water concentrations of 0-20 mg/L Cr(VI), <lb/>in one animal of the 20 mg/L Cr(VI) group and in one of the control <lb/>Fig. 1.

			<body>animals, the Fe content was slight to moderate (grade 2-3) <lb/>(Table 2). Iron content that was slight (grade 2) indicated small Fe <lb/>particles that were sparsely distributed in the bone marrow, which <lb/>were observed by 100Â magnification. Moderate Fe content (grade <lb/>3) indicated that many small Fe particles were present in reticulum <lb/>cells throughout bone marrow fragments. In several rats adminis-<lb/>tered 60 mg/L Cr(VI), the Fe content was slight to moderate (grade <lb/>2-3), in all animals of the highest dose group (180 mg/L Cr(VI)), the <lb/>Fe content was slight (grade 2) (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 2, there <lb/>were fewer bone marrow macrophages with blue staining (i.e. Fe) <lb/>in the 180 mg/L Cr(VI)-treated rat as compared to the control ani-<lb/>mal. In contrast, Prussian blue staining of bone marrow from <lb/>Cr(VI)-treated mice were unremarkable (data not shown). <lb/>3.2. Effects of Cr(VI) on genes involved in iron homeostasis <lb/>Three genes involved in Fe transport and absorption from the <lb/>intestinal lumen were significantly altered by Cr(VI) exposure. <lb/>Duodenal cytochrome b (DCYBT, Cybrd1) and divalent metal trans-<lb/>porter 1 (DMT1, Slc11a2) are expressed on the apical membrane of <lb/>villus enterocytes and function together to absorb non-heme Fe in <lb/>the diet. DCYBT is responsible for reducing luminal Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ , <lb/>which is subsequently transported into the enterocyte via DMT1. <lb/>Heme-based Fe is acquired by transport of dietary heme across <lb/>the villus enterocyte via heme carrier protein 1 (HCP1, Slc46a1). <lb/>Slc11a2 was elevated in both species at both time points in a <lb/>dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). After 90 days of exposure, Slc11a2 <lb/>was induced $4-fold in rats at 180 mg/L Cr(VI), and $1.6-fold in <lb/>mice. Cybrd1 expression was decreased in mice at both day 8 and <lb/>91, but was only significantly reduced in rats at day 8. Slc46a1 <lb/>expression was reduced in both species at both time points (Fig. 3). <lb/>Transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1, Tfr1) is primarily involved in Fe <lb/>uptake from the blood and is thus usually expressed on the baso-<lb/>lateral membrane. Ferrotransferrin (i.e. Fe-bound transferrin) in <lb/>the blood binds to TFR1 thereby stimulating endocytosis and cellu-<lb/>lar Fe absorption. Like Slc11a2, Tfr1 expression was increased in a <lb/>dose-dependent manner in both species at day 8 and day 91. At <lb/>day 8, the expression of Tfr1 was quite robust in both species with <lb/>increases ranging 4-to 5-fold (Fig. 3). By day 91, Tfr1 induction was <lb/>higher in rats than mice. <lb/>Two genes expressed on the basolateral enterocyte membrane <lb/>that are involved in the export of duodenal Fe were also altered <lb/>by Cr(VI). Ferroportin (Slc40a1) is responsible for the export of <lb/>Fe 2+ into the blood where it is subsequently oxidized to Fe 3+ by <lb/>hephaestin (Heph) so that it can bind to transferrin. Slc40a1 was <lb/>down-regulated in both species at day 8, unchanged in rats at <lb/>Fig. 2. Prussian blue staining of bone smears from F344 rats exposed to 0 (A) and 180 mg/L Cr(VI) (B) for 90 days.

			<body>day 91, and down-regulated in mice at day 91 (albeit insignifi-<lb/>cantly). Heph was down-regulated in both species at both time <lb/>points (Fig. 3). <lb/>In addition to these membrane-bound enzymes/genes, heme <lb/>oxygenase 1 (Hmox1), which is also involved in Fe regulation, <lb/>was elevated at day 91 in mice but not rats (Fig. 3). Heme oxygen-<lb/>ase is involved in the catabolism of heme to CO, Fe 2+ , and biliver-<lb/>din. Thus, elevation in Hmox1 might have led to increased <lb/>cellular Fe, which might partially explain why Slc11a2 and Tfr1 <lb/>expression was less affected in mice than rats at day 91 (Fig. 3). <lb/>Diagram 1 summarizes the aforementioned gene changes in rats <lb/>and the potential influence of Cr(VI) on Fe homeostasis. <lb/>3.3. Cr(VI) disposition <lb/>Based on concentrations of total Cr measured in RBCs and plas-<lb/>ma, RBC:plasma ratios were assessed in rats and mice for the dif-<lb/>ferent dose groups. The ratio of Cr concentration in RBCs and <lb/>plasma has long been used in studies as a biomarker of systemi-<lb/>cally absorbed Cr(VI) (Alexander and Aaseth, 1995; Buttner and <lb/>Beyersmann, 1985; Gray and Sterling, 1950). As shown in Fig. 4, <lb/>the RBC:plasma ratio increased in both species in a dose-depen-<lb/>dent manner, but the increase appears at lower doses in rats than <lb/>in mice. The RBC:plasma ratio was above unity (&gt;1) in rats admin-<lb/>istered drinking water concentrations of 20 mg/L Cr(VI) and higher <lb/>(dose of P2.90 mg/kg). In mice, the RBC:plasma ratio was &gt;1 at <lb/>drinking water concentrations of 60 mg/L Cr(VI) and higher (dose <lb/>of P11.70 mg/kg). <lb/>4. Discussion <lb/>Previous studies have shown that high concentrations of Cr(VI) <lb/>induce anemia in rodents (NTP, 1996, 1997, 2007, 2008b), which <lb/>may be explained by the disruption of Fe homeostasis by Cr(VI). <lb/>This current study is the first to demonstrate Fe depletion from <lb/>the duodenum, liver, serum, and bone marrow following exposure <lb/>to high concentrations of Cr(VI) in drinking water (Figs. 1 and 2; <lb/>Table 2). Moreover, Cr(VI) altered the expression of several key <lb/>genes involved in Fe homeostasis (Fig. 3; Diagram 1). Many of <lb/>the duodenal gene changes in response to Cr(VI) are consistent <lb/>with previously reported duodenal gene changes in rats placed <lb/>on Fe-deficient diets. Collins et al. (2005) studied genomic re-<lb/>sponses in the duodena of rats placed on Fe-deficient diets at dif-<lb/>ferent stages of development (suckling through adulthood), and <lb/>reported increases in Slc11a2, Cybrd1, Tfr1 and Hmox1, decreases <lb/>in Heph, and no change in Slc40a1. Among those genes induced <lb/>by an Fe-deficient diet, Slc11a2 and Tfr1 were induced by Cr(VI) <lb/>in both species; and Hmox1 was induced by Cr(VI) in mice. The <lb/>notable exception was Cybrd1, which was decreased by Cr(VI) in <lb/>both species. Consistent with changes in rats fed an Fe-deficient <lb/>diet for 9 weeks (Collins et al., 2005), mRNA levels of Heph were <lb/>decreased in both rats and mice exposed to Cr(VI). With regard <lb/>to ferroportin (Slc40a1), the lack of change in rats and mice at <lb/>day 91 is also consistent with the findings of Collins et al. (2005). <lb/>Thus, with the notable exception of Cybrd1, the gene changes in <lb/>rats and mice were generally consistent with dietary Fe deficiency. <lb/>These findings support the hypothesis that high concentrations of <lb/>Cr(VI) in the intestinal lumen can oxidize luminal Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ <lb/>thereby hindering Fe absorption. Indeed, we have shown that the <lb/>high concentrations of Cr(VI) used in the 2-year NTP bioassay are <lb/>not entirely reduced to Cr(III) by gastric fluid and thus high levels <lb/>of Cr(VI) are expected to be present in the intestinal lumen (Proctor <lb/>Diagram 1. Summary of gene expression changes in rats and potential influence of <lb/>Cr on Fe Homeostasis. Ferric iron (Fe 3+ ) in the intestinal lumen is reduced to ferrous <lb/>iron (Fe 2+ ) by cytochrome b reductase (DCYBT, Cyprd1). Fe 2+ then enters the apical <lb/>membrane of the enterocyte via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1, Slc11a2). Fe 2+ <lb/>can then be stored in ferritin or enter the bloodstream at the basolateral membrane <lb/>via ferroportin (Slc40a1). Fe 2+ is then oxidized to Fe 3+ by hephaestin (Heph) so that it <lb/>can bind to transferrin. Diferric transferrin binds transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1) and <lb/>mediates Fe uptake via endocytosis. Heme is taken up by heme carrier protein 1 <lb/>(HCP1, Slc46a1) and subsequently catabolized to Fe 2+ , CO, and the antioxidant <lb/>biliverdin by heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1). Genes that were generally up or down <lb/>regulated in F344 rats by Cr(VI) are colored red or green, respectively. The presence <lb/>of Cr(VI, IV, and V) can oxidize Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ (shown in the lumen), which may hinder <lb/>Fe 2+ absorption. Once transported into the enterocyte through anion transporters, <lb/>Cr(VI) can be reduced by cytoplasmic reductants (R C , e.g. ascorbate, GSH) to Cr(III). <lb/>Cr(III) can bind to certain Fe-binding proteins. Cr(VI, V, and IV) may also compete <lb/>with Fe 3+ for reductants in the lumen (R L , e.g. ascorbate, cysteine). <lb/>0 <lb/>1 0 <lb/>2 0 <lb/>3 0 <lb/>4 0 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>Cr(VI), mg/kg <lb/>Total Cr RBC:Plasma <lb/>Rats <lb/>Mice <lb/>Fig. 4.

			<body>et al., 2012). There are other important genes expressed primarily <lb/>in the liver that regulate Fe homeostasis including hepcidin and <lb/>transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2). In this study, toxicogenomic analyses <lb/>were conducted on duodenal samples and thus hepcidin and TFR2 <lb/>expressions were not quantified. Studies that assess gene <lb/>expression in liver samples of animals treated with Cr(VI) will be <lb/>informative to further describe Fe perturbations from Cr(VI) <lb/>exposures. <lb/>In addition to the apparent disruption of Fe absorption from the <lb/>intestinal lumen, we observed dose-dependent changes in Cr dis-<lb/>position based on Cr RBC:plasma ratios calculated for both species <lb/>(Fig. 4). If Cr(VI) enters the bloodstream, it can be transported into <lb/>RBCs, reduced to Cr(III), and subsequently bind to heme. Hence, <lb/>intracellular Cr(III) will be trapped for the lifespan of the RBC. <lb/>The RBC lifespan is 120, 66, and 42 mean days in humans, rats, <lb/>and mice, respectively (Derelanko, 1987; Shemin and Rittenberg, <lb/>1946; Van Putten, 1958). If Cr(VI) is reduced extracellularly to <lb/>Cr(III) in the blood or if Cr(III) enters the blood, Cr will not readily <lb/>accumulate in RBCs; thus, concentrations of Cr in plasma and RBCs <lb/>remain approximately equal. We observed concentrations of total <lb/>Cr in RBCs exceeding that of plasma at P20 and P60 mg/L Cr(VI) <lb/>in rats and mice, respectively (Fig. 4). Our previous kinetics re-<lb/>search suggests that the reducing capacity of rat stomach contents <lb/>reaches saturation at $20 mg Cr(VI)/L in drinking water, and is <lb/>greatly exceeded at 60 and 180 mg/L (Proctor et al., 2012). We have <lb/>previously shown that plasma GSH/GSSG ratios of rats and mice <lb/>were significantly decreased following 90 days of exposure at <lb/>P60 mg/L Cr(VI) (Thompson et al., 2012), which may further <lb/>suggest the presence of Cr(VI) in the blood. Taken together, <lb/>multiple lines of evidence suggest a dose-dependent change in Cr <lb/>disposition occurring at approximately 20-60 mg/L in rodents. <lb/>Disruption of Fe homeostasis by Cr(VI) may play a role in the <lb/>toxic responses observed in Cr(VI) drinking water bioassays. <lb/>Although the relationship between Fe depletion and adverse out-<lb/>comes has not been evaluated specifically in chronic rodent stud-<lb/>ies, we examined the findings of the 2-year NTP bioassay and our <lb/>90-day study (NTP, 2008b; Thompson et al., 2012) which may be <lb/>associated with Fe deficiency (Table 3). In both studies, many out-<lb/>comes potentially associated with Fe deficiency as outlined in <lb/>Table 3 were observed; effects potentially related to Fe deficiency <lb/>were more consistently observed in female as compared to male <lb/>rats, and in rats compared to mice. In addition, these effects poten-<lb/>tially related to Fe were mostly all high dose effects, occurring at <lb/>P20 mg/L Cr(VI). Although the incidence of chronic liver inflam-<lb/>mation, which might be related to Fe depletion, was significantly <lb/>increased at 5 mg/L in females, the severity was increased at <lb/>P60 mg/L. Thus, the perturbation of Fe homeostasis by Cr(VI) <lb/>and the associated health effects appear to be limited to high dose <lb/>exposure. <lb/>The MOA for rat oral tumors observed in the 2-year NTP bio-<lb/>assay of Cr(VI) has not been described specifically in the scien-<lb/>tific literature. There is some evidence that nutritional status <lb/>that can affect saliva, salivary glands, oral health, and possibly <lb/>the risk of oral carcinogenesis (Lingstrom and Moynihan, 2003; <lb/>Table 3 <lb/>Summary of effects potentially associated with iron homeostasis observed in 2-year NTP bioassay (NTP, 2008b) and 90-day mode of action (MOA) drinking water study <lb/>(Thompson et al., 2012). a <lb/>Endpoint <lb/>Study <lb/>Dose-related trend observed <lb/>Evidence for potential association with iron <lb/>Rats <lb/>Mice <lb/>Histiocytic infiltration <lb/>NTP <lb/>(2008b) <lb/>Increased in liver, duodenum, <lb/>and mesenteric lymph nodes: <lb/>males (P20 mg/L) females <lb/>(P60 mg/L) <lb/>Increased in males and <lb/>females for duodenum, <lb/>mesenteric lymph <lb/>nodes <lb/>Iron can be displaced from iron-binding proteins by <lb/>Cr(III).

			<body>Moynihan and Lingstrom, 2005). Moreover, saliva may play an <lb/>important role in oral carcinogenesis (pull refs from Section 5: <lb/>Wallenius 1965, 1966; Naglar and Dayan (2006), Vered et al. <lb/>(2010), Smiler (1970), Stich et al. (1982)). It is possible that <lb/>Fe-deficiency reported herein may have played a role for the <lb/>rat oral tumors. Experimentally-induced anemia, for example, <lb/>has been shown to potentiate the oral carcinogenicity of 4-nitro-<lb/>quinoline 1-oxide (Prime et al., 1983), and several chemicals that <lb/>induce oral cancers in rats, also cause microcytic anemia. For <lb/>example, Ramot et al. (2012) recently observed that gavage <lb/>doses of 3,3 0 -4,4 0 -tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB) induced oral tu-<lb/>mors in rats in the oral mucosa adjacent to molar teeth in nasal <lb/>section III, which is the same location as oral tumors induced by <lb/>Cr(VI) in the 2-year NTP bioassay. TCAB has been shown to cause <lb/>microcytic normochromic responsive anemia in male Sprague-<lb/>Dawley rats (NTP, 2010). Although TCAB and Cr(VI) are not <lb/>known to act by the same MOA, microcytic anemia might con-<lb/>tribute to formation of rat oral tumors observed following expo-<lb/>sure to both chemicals. Also in humans, conditions of anemia <lb/>such as Plummer-Vinson syndrome have been linked to oral can-<lb/>cer (Kumar et al., 2005; Lucenteforte et al., 2009; Richie et al., <lb/>2008). Yet based on the currently available data, it is not feasible <lb/>to discern effects caused by Cr(VI) directly from those that may <lb/>be induced or exacerbated by Fe deficiency at high doses. It may <lb/>be useful to consider future studies in rodents that investigate <lb/>the potential role of long-term Fe disruption and depletion in <lb/>context of Cr(VI) exposure. Finally, it cannot be ruled out that <lb/>other general signs of poor health such as reduced bodyweight <lb/>gain and water intake might have contributed to the outcomes <lb/>observed in the 2-year NTP bioassay (Supplemental Fig. S2). <lb/>Herein we have described biochemical and molecular support <lb/>for previously observed Cr(VI)-induced microcytic anemia in ro-<lb/>dents. Moreover, Cr(VI)-induced Fe deficiency may have caused <lb/>or contributed to other adverse effects of Cr(VI) observed in ani-<lb/>mal bioassays. Most adverse effects potentially related to Fe defi-<lb/>ciency occur at Cr(VI) drinking water concentrations that <lb/>correspond with a shift in the toxicokinetics of Cr(VI) absorption, <lb/>occurring in rats at P20 mg/L. Because Fe depletion mainly oc-<lb/>curred at very high concentrations of Cr(VI) in drinking water, <lb/>adverse outcomes associated with disruption of Fe homeostasis <lb/>are not likely at typical U.S. drinking water exposures, recently <lb/>reported to range from $0.00003 mg/L to 0.091 mg/L, with med-<lb/>ian value of 0.0002 mg/L (USEPA, 2013). Based on these data, <lb/>this study provides evidence of perturbations in Fe homeostasis <lb/>from exposures to high concentration of Cr(VI) (P20 mg/L) in <lb/>drinking water. The findings of this study may be useful to guide <lb/>experimental designs of future studies to evaluate Fe homeosta-<lb/>sis disturbance and potentially related adverse effects from pro-<lb/>longed exposures to Cr(VI). <lb/></body>
