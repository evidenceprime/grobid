Abstract 
Objectives: Endoscopic submucosal resection with band ligation (ESMR-L) 
and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are both standard endoscopic 
resection methods for rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) <10 mm in 
size. However, there is no definitive consensus on which is better. Here, we 
compared the efficacy of ESMR-L and ESD for small rectal NETs. 
Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study including 205 
patients with rectal NETs who underwent ESMR-L or ESD. Treatment out-
comes were compared by univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and 
inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity scores. Sub-
group analysis evaluated the impact of the endoscopist's experience on the 
technical outcome.

Results: Eighty-nine patients were treated by ESMR-L and 116 by ESD. The 
R0 resection rate was not significantly different between the two (90% vs. 
92%, p = 0.73). The procedure time of ESMR-L was significantly shorter 
than for ESD (17 min vs. 52 min, p < 0.01) and the hospitalization period 
was also significantly shorter (3 days vs. 5 days, p < 0.01). These results 
were confirmed by multivariate analysis and also after IPTW adjustment. The 
procedure time of ESD was significantly prolonged by a less-experienced 
endoscopist (49 min vs.70 min,p = 0.02),but that of ESMR-L was not affected 
(17 min vs. 17 min, p = 0.27). 
Conclusions: For small rectal NETs, both ESMR-L and ESD showed similar 
high complete resection rates. However, considering the shorter proce-
dure time and shorter hospitalization period, ESMR-L is the more efficient 
treatment method, especially for less-experienced endoscopists.

INTRODUCTION 

Rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one of the 
most common types of digestive NETs. The inci-
dence of detected rectal NETs has increased in the 
past few decades due to the increased number of 
colonoscopies. 1-5 As rectal NETs <10 mm in size carry 
a low risk of lymph node metastasis, 6-9 current guide-
lines recommend local excision including endoscopic 
resection (ER) for these tumors. 10 
There are many established ER methods, including 
conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (c-EMR), 11 
endoscopic submucosal resection with band ligation 
(ESMR-L), 12 endoscopic submucosal resection with cap 
aspiration (ESMR-C), 13 EMR after circumferential inci-
sion (precutting EMR), 14 and endoscopic submucosal 
dissection (ESD). 15 Of these, especially ESMR-L and 
ESD are commonly performed procedures for rectal 
NET resection in daily clinical practice. Several reports 
address the efficacy of modified EMR (ESMR-L, ESMR-
C, and precutting EMR) and ESD. 16-19 However, most 
of these reports are from a single high-volume center, 
and there are a few from multiple facilities. Furthermore, 
there have been no reports focused on the impact of 
the endoscopist's experience on treatment outcomes for 
each of these ER methods. Thus, additional evidence is 
required to establish an optimal strategy for ER in rectal 
NETs. Therefore, we surveyed the results of ER treat-
ments for small rectal NETs in a multi-center database, 
focusing on a comparison between ESMR-L and ESD. 

METHODS 

Patients 

This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 
patients who underwent ESMR-L or ESD from 2010 to 

2019 for rectal NETs <10 mm in size. This study was 
conducted at 11 Japanese facilities, including univer-
sity hospitals, general hospitals, and practicing clinics. 
Relevant data of the patients and lesions collected 
from the clinical records were analyzed. The evalu-
ation items were as follows: clinical background of 
the patient, the ER method, the procedure time, per-
forations and postoperative bleeding as complications, 
the R0 resection rate, and the hospitalization period. 
Patients who were treated other than by ESMR-L or 
ESD, such as by c-EMR, ESMR-C, or precutting EMR, 
were excluded. Patients with multiple lesions were also 
excluded. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all 
patients prior to treatment. This study was approved 
by the Ethical Committee of Kumamoto University 
Hospital (approval number 2015) and performed in 
accordance with the ethical principles associated with 
the Declaration of Helsinki. 

Endoscopic procedures 

In accordance with the guidelines, rectal NETs less 
than 10 mm without obvious muscular invasion or 
metastasis were indicated for ER. Most cases were 
treated after the histological diagnosis of NET by endo-
scopic biopsies. Prior to the procedure, endoscopic 
ultrasonography to rule out muscle layer invasion and 
computed tomography to rule out metastases were 
usually performed. 
In the ESMR-L procedure, the lesion is aspirated 
and ligated using a ligation device (Sumitomo Bakelite 
Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) after submucosal injection, and 
resected with a snare placed below the ligation band. 
Routinely, saline was used for submucosal injection, and 
endoscopic closure of mucosal defects was with clips 
after resection.

In the ESD procedure, incision and deeper cutting cre-
ate a mucosal flap after submucosal injection; thereafter, 
a circumferential incision with submucosal dissection is 
performed until the tumor can be completely removed. 
A Dual knife (KD-650Q; Olympus) or a Flush knife 
(DK2618JB; Fujifilm) was mainly used for the ESD pro-
cedure. Coagulation was occasionally performed with 
hemostatic forceps for the exposed vessels after resec-
tion. Routinely, 0.4% hyaluronic acid (MucoUP; Boston 
Scientific Japan Co.) was used, and endoscopic closure 
for mucosal defects was not conducted after resection. 
All of the procedures were carried out by a total of 60 
different endoscopists. The choice of ER method was 
made by each endoscopist. 

Histological evaluation 

Hematoxylin-Eosin and immunohistochemical staining 
(chromogranin A, synaptophysin) was performed on 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples after ER. 
Tumor size, invasion depth, lymphatic and vascular 
involvement, and tumor involvement in the lateral and 
vertical margins, were histologically assessed. The 
lympho-vascular invasion was usually evaluated by 
immunostaining (CD34, Victoria blue, and D2-40). Ki-
67 was used to evaluate cell proliferation and classify 
the grade of the tumor. Grade 1 was defined as hav-
ing a mitotic count <2 per 10 high-power fields and/or 
Ki67 ≤2%. The pathological diagnosis was based on the 
2010 World Health Organization classification of tumors 
of the digestive system. 

Definition 

The procedure time was defined as the time from inser-
tion to the removal of the endoscope. Perforation was 
defined as a visible hole in the rectum wall recog-
nized during the procedure, or free air detected by 
abdominal computed tomography after the procedure. 
Postoperative bleeding was defined as the presence 
of fresh bloody stool, which required urgent endoscopy 
for hemostasis. R0 resection was defined as en bloc 
resection with tumor-free lateral and vertical margins. 
"Experienced" endoscopists were defined as having 
performed more than 3000 colonoscopies and 500 
colonic c-EMR and/or 30 colonic ESD at each point of 
treatment. 

Statistical analysis 

Clinical outcomes were analyzed using the Mann-
Whitney U test, Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test, or 
chi-squared test, as appropriate. Multivariate logistic and 
linear regression models were also employed based 

on propensity scores to adjust for candidate confound-
ing factors. To generate the propensity score, logistic 
regression was performed using the ER method as the 
outcome, and the five variables were age, sex, tumor 
location, tumor size, and endoscopists' experience. Lin-
ear regression models using patients from each medical 
facility as a cluster were employed to evaluate asso-
ciations between treatment and outcome. In addition, 
the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) 
method based on propensity scoring was used to esti-
mate the average treatment effect of ESMR-L compared 
to ESD. In these models, outcome variables such as 
ESD procedure time or dissection speed were log-
transformed because of their skewed distribution. Thus, 
in the multivariate linear regression models, the ESMR-L 
and ESD procedure times were compared by estimating 
the exponentials of regression coefficients. Probability 
values for statistical tests were two-tailed and p < 0.05 
was considered significant. Statistical analysis was per-
formed with R version 3.3.3 (R Foundation, Vienna, 
Austria), and STATA15.1 (StataCorp, Lakeway Drive, 
Texas). 

RESULTS 

From January 2010 to December 2019, a total of 218 
patients who underwent ER for rectal NETs <10 mm 
enrolled from 11 institutions for this study. Of these, we 
excluded 10 patients who underwent ER by a method 
other than ESMR-L or ESD (these were four c-EMR, five 
ESMR-C, and one precutting EMR). We also excluded 
three patients who had multiple NET lesions resected 
in a single procedure. Hence, we finally analyzed 205 
patients, 89 of whom were treated by ESMR-L, and 116 
by ESD. The study flowchart is shown in Figure 1. 
The characteristics of the patients and their lesions 
are shown in Table 1. The lesions were mainly located 
in the lower rectum (n = 177, 86%), and the median 
tumor size was 5 mm. The mean age of the patients who 
underwent ESD was higher than that of ESMR-L (53±13 
years vs. 58 ± 13 years, p = 0.02), and the median tumor 
size in the former was larger (4 mm vs. 5 mm, p < 0.01). 
The proportion of experienced endoscopists was signif-
icantly greater than for ESD compared to ESMR-L (80% 
vs. 55%, p = 0.04). 
Table 2 depicts the univariate analysis of treatment 
outcomes. All lesions were resected en bloc either by 
ESMR-L or ESD, with no significant difference in the R0 
resection rate (90% vs. 92%, p = 0.73). The procedure 
time was significantly shorter for ESMR-L than for ESD 
patients (17 min vs. 52 min, p < 0.01), and the hospi-
talization period was also shorter for ESMR-L patients 
(3 days vs. 5 days, p< 0.01). No instance of perforation 
was found in any of the patients, and the rate of post-
operative bleeding was not significantly different (7% vs. 
2%, p = 0.14). All cases of postoperative bleeding were

successfully managed with endoscopic hemostasis, and 
no blood transfusion or surgery was required. We also 
showed the clinical outcomes of each 11 institutions in 
Table S1. 
Multivariate regression analysis was then applied to 
compare ESMR-L with ESD, confirming that the proce-
dure time was significantly shorter for the former (odds 
ratio = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26-0.40, p 
< 0.001) and that the R0 resection rate was not signif-
icantly different (odds ratio = 0.62, 95% CI 0.08-4.58, 
p = 0.641; Table 3). The hospitalization period was also 
confirmed to be significantly shorter after ESMR-L (odds 
ratio = 0.45, 95% CI 0.24-0.86, p = 0.021; Table 3). 
In the IPTW analysis, the estimated mean procedure 
time when using the ESMR-L method was also signif-
icantly shorter than for ESD (odds ratio = 0.33, 95% 
CI 0.27-0.41, p < 0.001), and again, the R0 resection 
rate was not significantly different (odds ratio = 0.98, 
95% CI 0.89-1.07, p = 0.614; Table 3). The hospital-
ization period was also significantly shorter for patients 
after ESMR-L (odds ratio = 0.46, 95% CI 0.39-0.53, p < 
0.001; Table 3). 
In the subgroup analysis, we evaluated the impact 
of the endoscopist's experience on the technical out-
comes for each ER method. For the ESMR-L, there was 
no difference in procedure time between experienced 
and less-experienced endoscopists (17 min vs. 17 min, 
p = 0.269; Table 4). On the other hand, for ESD, the 
median procedure time was longer in cases treated by 

less-experienced endoscopists (49 min vs. 70 min, p = 
0.017;Table 4).There was no significant difference in the 
R0 resection rate whether performed by experienced or 
less-experienced endoscopist both in ESMR-L (86.4% 
vs. 96.7%, p = 0.263; Table 4) and ESD procedure 
(92.5% vs. 91.3%, p > 0.99; Table 4). The hospitalization 
period was longer in both the ESMR-L (2 days vs. 3 days, 
p < 0.023; Table 4) and ESD groups (5 days vs. 8 days, 
p < 0.001; Table 4) when treated by less-experienced 
endoscopists. 
We also examined the impact of endoscopist experi-
ence level on treatment outcomes using linear or logistic 
regression models adjusted by propensity score. The 
procedure time of ESD was significantly prolonged by 
less-experienced endoscopists (odds ratio = 1.42, 95% 
CI 1.12-1.80, p = 0.009; Table S2), but that of ESMR-L 
was not affected (odds ratio = 1.14, 95% CI 0.92-1.40, 
p = 0.205; Table S2). ESMR-L performed by less-
experienced endoscopists did not result in lower R0 
resection rates (odds ratio = 3.94, 95% CI 0.32-47.96, 
p = 0.282; Table S2), and that was also confirmed by the 
ESD procedure (odds ratio = 0.75, 95% CI 0.16-3.53, 
p = 0.716; Table S2). 
In this study, 27 patients (13%) had a lympho-vascular 
invasion. Of which, 13 underwent additional surgery, and 
one of them was found to have lymph node metastasis. 
No apparent lymph node recurrence was observed in 
patients who did not undergo additional surgery. There 
were no confirmed cases of local recurrence during

the follow-up period, with a median 35-month (interquar-
tile range 25%-75%, 14-61) follow-up observation. In 
contrast, a distant metastatic recurrence was confirmed 
in one case in the ESD group. The lesion was NET 
grade 2 of WHO classification, 7 mm in size without 
lympho-vascular invasion, and the horizontal and ver-
tical margins were free. However, the patient did not 
accept the additional surgery. After more than 9 years 
passed since the ESD procedure, multiple liver masses 
were pointed out, and the biopsy revealed a recurrence 
of NET. 

DISCUSSION 

In this retrospective study for rectal NETs <10 mm 
in size, the patients who underwent ESMR-L required 
a significantly shorter procedure and shorter hospi-
talization period than those who underwent ESD, but 
there was no difference in the R0 resection rate. These 
results were confirmed after adjusting for confound-
ing factors using both multivariate analysis and the 
IPTW method. Interestingly, the level of endoscopists' 
experience significantly affected the procedure time 
for ESD more than for ESMR-L, and ESMR-L per-
formed by less-experienced endoscopists did not result 
in lower R0 resection rates. Both resection meth-
ods resulted in a longer hospitalization period when 
treated by less-experienced endoscopists. There was 
no significant difference in the complication rates by 
endoscopist's experience. This might be because the 
patients treated by less-experienced endoscopists had 
a longer hospital stay after treatment and were followed 
more carefully. 
In our study, the R0 resection rate was not significantly 
different between ESMR-L and ESD (90% vs. 92%, p 
= 0.73), similar to what has been previously reported 
(81%-100%, 54%-100%, respectively). 12-25 However, 
our simulation using the data of this study revealed 
that the statistical power to verify the non-inferiority of 
ESMR-L compared to ESD was low (<0.1), suggesting 
the necessity of further investigations with a large sam-
ple size. There have been two meta-analyses comparing 
ESD and modified EMR, which include ESMR-L and 
EMR-C, as ER methods for rectal NETs. 26,27 The latest 
meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the 
R0 resection rate between ESMR-L and ESD, consistent 
with our results. All of these previous reports found that 
the procedure time of ESMR-L was significantly shorter 
than ESD, as we also found. Most of these reports were 
from a single high-volume center, and the number of 
cases in each report was small. Hence, in contrast, our 
study had a relatively large number of cases from multi-
ple institutions, including the university hospital, general 
hospitals, and practicing clinics. The guidelines did not 
specify which resection method is recommended. 10,28 
Additional evidence is still needed. 

In most cases for which R0 resection was not 
achieved, the vertical margins were either unclear or 
positive. Free vertical margins are the most important 
for achieving the complete resection of small rectal 
NETS. For the ESD procedure, the submucosal dis-
section should be performed just above the muscular 
layer in order to avoid the burning effect on the tumor. 
However,this procedure benefits from more experienced 
endoscopic skills and entails a longer procedure time. In 
contrast, ESMR-L is a relatively simple and rapid proce-
dure not requiring so much endoscopic experience and 
skill. For this reason, the endoscopist's experience sig-
nificantly affected the procedure time of ESD more than 
ESMR-L. ESMR-L also has an economic advantage 
because it does not require the use of various differ-
ent endoscopic knives, hemostat forceps, and expensive 
liquids for submucosal injection. In addition, a shorter 
hospitalization period is favorable in terms of medical 
costs. 
All of the horizontal margins were negative in the ESD 
group, whereas three cases of horizontal margins were 
unclear in the ESMR-L group.This may be due to the fact 
that specimens after ESMR-L were often not stretched 
and fixed on the board before being fixed in formalin. 
Although no additional surgical resection was performed 
in these three cases with unclear horizontal margins, 
none of them had obvious local recurrence. Of the three 
patients with unclear horizontal margins, two also had 
unclear vertical margins. Only one patient had unclear 
horizontal margins with free vertical margins. This lesion 
was located near the scar of c-EMR that had been per-
formed previously. ESD would be better indicated for 
such a lesion near the scar because of its flexibility in 
the resection area. ESD would also be more suitable 
for large rectal NET lesions, although it is not usually 
indicated for ER. 
There is no definitive consensus on the definition 
of "experienced" endoscopists. In the systematic liter-
ature review of learning curves for colorectal polyp 
resection techniques, 29 higher en bloc and complete 
resection rates were achieved in 50-300 cases with the 
colonic c-EMR procedure and 20-40 cases with 
the ESD procedure. Furthermore, it was reported that 
the procedural speed was increased after 30 cases 
in the ESD procedure. Because only a few endoscopists 
had extensive experience with ESMR-L procedures and 
colorectal ESD procedures in our study, we also defined 
"experienced" endoscopists with extensive colonoscopy 
and colonic c-EMR experiences. 
Our study has some limitations. First, this is a ret-
rospective analysis of procedures. The choice of ER 
methods was dependent on the institution and the oper-
ator, and there were no clear criteria. Although we have 
adjusted for candidate confounding factors, it might be 
a major selection bias. Second, the timing of treatment 
might affect the technical results since the duration of 
our study period was 10 years. Third, because this study

focused on treatment outcomes, the long-term outcome 
data were insufficient to draw any conclusions in later 
clinical courses. Forth, the procedure time of our study 
seemed to be longer than in the previous reports.It might 
be due to the definition of procedure time as the time 
from insertion to the removal of the endoscope. Despite 
these limitations,the strength of our study is that it exam-
ined the impact of endoscopists´experience on each 
ER method for rectal NETs with a relatively large num-
ber of cases, and analyzed the treatment outcome of 
many endoscopists a further strength. 
In conclusion, compared with ESD, ESMR-L had 
a shorter procedure time and shorter hospitalization 
period despite the similar R0 resection rate and com-
plication rate. The procedure time of ESD was affected 
by the endoscopists'experience but that of ESMR-L was 
not. Therefore, ESMR-L is considered to be a more effi-
cient treatment method than ESD for small rectal NETs, 
especially for less-experienced endoscopists.
