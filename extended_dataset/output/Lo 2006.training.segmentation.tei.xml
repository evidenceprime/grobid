This study aimed to determine whether the <lb/>Chinese RSUI could adopt the US-based multi-attribute utility function (MAUF) in scoring rhinitis <lb/>symptoms. Methods: In a Hong Kong study, 116 Chinese adults with allergic rhinitis completed the RSUI <lb/>questionnaire and 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) after they had been seen by two otorhino <lb/>laryngologists for disease-severity ratings. Respondents then completed computer-administered direct <lb/>preference measures, i.e., visual analogue scale (VAS) and standard gamble (SG) assessments. The VAS and <lb/>SG data were used to estimate a MAUF for the Chinese-based RSUI. Results: The derived MAUF was <lb/>somewhat different than the one developed for the US RSUI. Test-retest reliability for the Chinese RSUI <lb/>was satisfactory (ICC = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001). Scores differentiated among cases with mild, moderate, and severe <lb/>symptoms {p&lt; 0.001); and between those who did and did not require medications to control symptoms <lb/>(/? = 0.031). Findings were significantly correlated with SF-36 domain scores (r = 0.19 to 0.37; /? = 0.041 to <lb/>&lt; 0.001). When the US-based scoring function was applied to the Chinese subjects, the resulting mean <lb/>RSUI score was significantly lower {p&lt; 0.001). Comparisons between directly measured VAS and SG <lb/>scores between the US and Chinese samples, demonstrated significant differences (all p &lt; 0.05), with the US <lb/>subjects consistently rating rhinitis symptoms as worse than Chinese subjects. Conclusions: The Chinese <lb/>RSUI has good measurement properties that reflect patient preferences from the Chinese. Results suggest <lb/>that there are differences in preference rating between US and Chinese subjects and that use of the US <lb/>based preference function for the RSUI would bias the measurement of rhinitis symptom outcomes in <lb/>Chinese subjects. <lb/>Key words: Health utility measurement, Patient preference, Rhinitis Symptom Utility Index, Standard <lb/>gamble <lb/></front>

			<body>their outcomes, including generic and disease <lb/>specific health status assessments and utility mea <lb/>sures. <lb/>There are two approaches for health status or <lb/>health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) evaluation, <lb/>the psychometric-and utility-based measures. <lb/>Using a psychometric method, HRQL is assessed <lb/>with multiple domains such as physical, social, role <lb/>and emotional function and well-being. A utility <lb/>based (preference-based) technique aggregates all <lb/>health dimensions into a single index on a scale <lb/>measuring from 0 (dead or the worst health) to 1 <lb/>(perfect health or the best health). Utility-based <lb/>assessments can be classified as direct and multi <lb/>attribute measures [1]. The direct method requires <lb/>each individual to value either hypothetical health <lb/>states or subjectively defined current health states. <lb/>Common techniques for utility elicitations are <lb/>standard gamble (SG) and time trade-off (TTO) <lb/>exercises. The SG method, based directly on the <lb/>axioms of utility theory [2, 3], requires the <lb/>respondent to choose between two alternatives: (1) <lb/>life with a specific condition, or (2) a gamble with <lb/>either perfect health (probability p) or immediate <lb/>death/worst health (probability 1 -p). The TTO <lb/>requests the respondent to consider what length of <lb/>life they are willing tradeoff to get perfect health. <lb/>The multi-attribute method captures people&apos;s <lb/>health preferences in an indirect approach with the <lb/>use of a utility-weighted health classification sys <lb/>tem and scoring algorithm. This method facilitates <lb/>the collection of preference-based data in a con <lb/>venient way by asking subjects to complete a <lb/>questionnaire based on this health classification <lb/>system. <lb/>As a chronic disease, allergic rhinitis affects no <lb/>less than 20 percent of the population [4-7], and <lb/>each year billions of dollars are spent on pharma <lb/>ceutical products for symptom control [8, 9]. New <lb/>drugs are increasingly introduced into the health <lb/>care system, but little is known about patient pref <lb/>erences associated with the effects of these drugs. To <lb/>help clinicians to select cost-effective treatments, a <lb/>utility-based instrument is required for measuring <lb/>patient outcomes for economic evaluations. To <lb/>date, the Rhinitis Symptom Utility Index (RSUI) <lb/>developed by Revicki et al. [10], is the only available <lb/>preference-weighted outcome measure for the <lb/>evaluation of rhinitis symptoms. Outcome scores <lb/>are generated using a multi-attribute utility func <lb/>tion (MAUF) and rhinitis status classification sys <lb/>tem based on patient preferences in the United <lb/>States. <lb/>Few studies have examined similarities and dif <lb/>ferences in preference-based measures between <lb/>Western and Asian respondents, and it is uncertain <lb/>whether utilities are generalizable across cultures. <lb/>Could the US-based multi-attribute preference <lb/>weighted function be applied to scoring rhinitis <lb/>symptoms in Chinese patients? This study aimed <lb/>to answer the question by comparing the RSUI <lb/>scores derived from the US-and Chinese-based <lb/>preference functions using data collected from <lb/>Chinese subjects. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Rhinitis Symptom Utility Index (RSUI) <lb/>The RSUI is a preference-weighted measure of <lb/>common rhinitis symptoms [10]. In the question <lb/>naire (Appendix), five rhinitis-related symptoms <lb/>(stuffy or blocked nose, runny nose, sneezing, <lb/>itchy-watery eyes, and itchy nose or throat) are <lb/>assessed with four-point Likert scales in regard to <lb/>their frequency and severity during a 14-day peri <lb/>od. The frequency of each symptom is judged as <lb/>either &apos;not at all,&apos; &apos;1-3 days,&apos; &apos;4-7 days,&apos; or &apos;8 <lb/>14 days.&apos; The severity of each symptom is evalu <lb/>ated as &apos;not applicable,&apos; &apos;mild,&apos; &apos;moderate&apos; or <lb/>&apos;severe.&apos; The levels within each symptom (attri <lb/>bute) as listed in Table 1 vary from no symptoms <lb/>to severe symptoms for 8-14 days. The RSUI is a <lb/>single index of the overall rhinitis state on a scale <lb/>where the best state (no symptoms) has a score of 1 <lb/>and the worst rhinitis state (severe symptoms for <lb/>8-14 days) has a score of 0. <lb/>The RSUI questionnaire was translated into <lb/>Chinese using an iterative forward-backward <lb/>translation process, as defined by the International <lb/>Quality of Life Assessment Project Group [11]. <lb/>The method for translation followed an iterative <lb/>process of forward translation by independent <lb/>translators, review and testing, back translation by <lb/>independent translators, and review and testing <lb/>until a linguistic and culturally acceptable trans <lb/>lated version was developed. The final Chinese <lb/>translation of the RSUI was pilot tested with 20 <lb/>subjects using qualitative methods to examine the <lb/></body>

The pilot <lb/>study confirmed the quality of the translation and <lb/>cultural adaptation of the RSUI into Chinese. <lb/>Patient sample <lb/>Study subjects were a convenience sample of pa <lb/>tients who attended the ENT clinic at a university <lb/>affiliated hospital in Hong Kong. Ten patients <lb/>participated in a pilot test of visual props (i.e., <lb/>colored chance cards and probability wheels) for <lb/>assessing utilities, and another 10 patients partic <lb/>ipated in a pilot test of computer-interactive <lb/>interviews. Based on the pilot results, we deter <lb/>mined that the computer-administered approach <lb/>was acceptable and worked best given that the <lb/>respondents demonstrated better comprehension <lb/>and concentration in the computer administration. <lb/>One hundred and sixteen Chinese patients who <lb/>were aged 18 or older and had a history of allergic <lb/>rhinitis were recruited for the field test. Subjects <lb/>with sinusitis, cognitive disorder, cold or influenza <lb/>in the past 14 days, or a nasal surgery in the past <lb/>6 weeks were excluded from the study. In this <lb/>study, 84% of eligible patients contacted agreed to <lb/>participate. The most frequent reason for non <lb/>participation was the study time commitment. <lb/>Clinical and health-related measures <lb/>Disease severity <lb/>Prior to the questionnaire administration and <lb/>preference interviews, subjects were seen by two <lb/>otorhinolaryngologists for disease-severity ratings. <lb/>Lebel et al.&apos;s Rhinitis Symptom Score (RSS) [12] <lb/>was used to confirm the diagnosis and determine <lb/>disease severity. RSS scores were rated from 0 to <lb/>12 where higher scores indicated more severe <lb/>rhinitis symptoms. Based on the RSS rating and <lb/>clinical judgment, each physician independently <lb/>determined the patient&apos;s severity of rhinitis on a <lb/>six-point Likert scale from 1 (very mild rhinitis) to <lb/>6 (most severe rhinitis). The mean of the two <lb/>physician-ratings were used to define disease <lb/>severity where scores &lt;3 were defined as mild, <lb/>scores 3-4 as moderate, scores &gt; 4 as severe. <lb/>In addition, the respondent was asked to rate <lb/>his/her current rhinitis status from 0 (the worst <lb/>possible rhinitis state) to 100 (perfect health). VAS <lb/>67-99 was considered as mild, 34-66 as moderate, <lb/>and 0-33 as severe symptoms. Patients also <lb/>reported whether or not they required medications <lb/>to control their symptoms in the past two weeks. <lb/>Generic health status measure <lb/>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form <lb/>Health Survey (SF-36) Chinese Hong Kong ver <lb/>sion [13] was used to examine convergent validity <lb/>of the RSUI. In the SF-36 [14], one item measures <lb/>health transition. The remaining 35 items are <lb/>grouped into eight domains: physical functioning, <lb/>role limitation due to physical problems, bodily <lb/>pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, <lb/>role limitation due to emotional problems, and <lb/>mental health. Each domain score ranges from 0 to <lb/>100, where higher scale scores reflect better func <lb/>tioning and well-being.

			<body>has been used in multiple community-based clini <lb/>cal studies. <lb/>Preference-based measures <lb/>The preference-weighting scheme used to generate <lb/>the Chinese RSUI was based on the methods in the <lb/>original US RSUI study [10]. Five single symp <lb/>toms, each with 10 levels (see Appendix), were <lb/>rated on the 0-100 point VAS. Five corner <lb/>symptom states and five hypothetical multiple <lb/>symptom states (Table 2) were assessed using both <lb/>VAS rating scales and the standard gamble (SG). <lb/>A corner symptom state was defined as one <lb/>symptom at the worst possible level of severity <lb/>(i.e., most severe) and frequency (i.e., 8-14 days) <lb/>while the remaining four symptoms were absent. <lb/>Multiple symptom states were combinations of <lb/>different rhinitis symptoms with various levels of <lb/>severity and frequency. <lb/>For the VAS ratings, a vertical Feeling Ther <lb/>mometer (FT) marked with numerical scales from <lb/>0 to 100 units was presented to the patient in the <lb/>form of computer image. The FT was anchored at <lb/>one end by the worst rhinitis state (0) and at one <lb/>end by the best rhinitis state (100). For the within <lb/>attribute (symptom) VAS ratings, the &apos;worst rhi <lb/>nitis state&apos; was the most severe and frequent rele <lb/>vant symptom (i.e., runny nose on 8-14 days) and <lb/>the best rhinitis state was no symptom (i.e., no <lb/>runny nose). For the VAS ratings for the corner <lb/>and multisymptom-states, the worst rhinitis state <lb/>was defined as the all-worst state (i.e., all five <lb/>symptoms most severe on 8-14 days) and the best <lb/>rhinitis state was a state where none of the symp <lb/>toms were present. During the VAS assessment, <lb/>various hypothetical rhinitis states were displayed <lb/>adjacent to the FT, and the respondent indicated <lb/>the valuation of each hypothetical rhinitis state by <lb/>moving the level mark of the thermometer. Ties <lb/>were allowed and the relative spacing between <lb/>pairs of states had to reflect the subject&apos;s judgment <lb/>about the relative differences in preferences. The <lb/>respondent could view previous ratings on the <lb/>screen. Following the ranking of the single symp <lb/>tom states, corner states (one severe symptom <lb/>each), and multiple symptom states, the respon <lb/>dent rated his/her own health in current rhinitis <lb/>status. Time was allowed for the respondent to <lb/>re-adjust the ratings at the end of each session. <lb/>Changes were allowed even up to the end of the <lb/>FT measures. The numerical value of the FT <lb/>adjacent to the placement of each rhinitis state was <lb/>immediately saved in an electronic record during <lb/>the process. To enhance the patient&apos;s understand <lb/>ing of the rating tasks, a warm up exercise was <lb/>performed with the use of paper FT and rhinitis <lb/>state arrow-cards before the computer adminis <lb/>tration. <lb/>For the SG exercises, two colored circles (Op <lb/>tion A and Option B) were displayed on a com <lb/>puter screen.

			<body>B was a gamble of an uncertain rhinitis outcome <lb/>which varied the probabilities of either the best {p) <lb/>or the worst rhinitis state {l-p). The best rhinitis <lb/>state was described as none of the symptoms <lb/>present and the worst rhinitis state was the all <lb/>worst state (see above). During the computer <lb/>interactive interviews, the participant was asked to <lb/>state his/her preference choice between Option A <lb/>and Option B. The gamble in Option B started <lb/>with 100% chance of the best state (no symptoms) <lb/>and 0% chance of the worst rhinitis state for the <lb/>following two weeks. If the respondent selected <lb/>Option B, a click on the B button would make the <lb/>gamble change to 50% chance of the best state and <lb/>50% chance of the worst state. Again, the <lb/>respondent was asked to state his/her preference <lb/>between Option A and Option B. The process went <lb/>on and the probabilities of the best {p) and the <lb/>worse state {l-p) were varied in an iterative <lb/>interval-division manner [15] until the respondent <lb/>was indifferent to the choices between Option A <lb/>and Option B. This exercise was repeated for each <lb/>of the corner states and multi-symptom states. <lb/>Patient preferences under uncertainty for the <lb/>health states were represented on a scale from 0 to <lb/>1, where 0 stands for the worst rhinitis state and 1 <lb/>stands for the best rhinitis state. A warm-up <lb/>exercise with the aid of a probability wheel was <lb/>carried out before the actual computer-based <lb/>interview. The pre-test exercise aimed to introduce <lb/>or reinforce the concept of probability and most <lb/>important to ensure subject comprehension on the <lb/>meaning of &apos;indifference&apos; between the two alter <lb/>natives in the SG task. <lb/>Data collection procedures <lb/>After obtaining consent, the participant was seen <lb/>separately by two otorhinolaryngologists for the <lb/>diagnosis and disease-severity rating. On comple <lb/>tion of the RSUI and SF-36, the subject was <lb/>interviewed for preference measures by a single <lb/>well-trained interviewer. For the evaluation of <lb/>RSUI test-retest reliability, subjects completed the <lb/>RSUI two weeks after the baseline administration. <lb/>They also responded to a question on the change <lb/>in rhintis status on a five-point global scale where <lb/>1 = better, 2 = slightly better, 3 = more or less the <lb/>same, 4 = slightly worse, and 5 = worse. <lb/>Data analysis <lb/>The 100-point VAS values were transformed to a <lb/>scale of 0 to 1, where 0 indicated the worst <lb/>symptom(s) and 1 represented no symptom(s). To <lb/>facilitate comparisons with the US-based RSUI, <lb/>estimation procedures of the MAUF for the cur <lb/>rent project followed those in Revicki et al.&apos;s study <lb/>[10]. The conceptual framework and details on the <lb/>method were described elsewhere [16, 17]. <lb/>Developing the multi-attribute utility function <lb/>(MAUF) <lb/>We applied the person-mean approach for the <lb/>estimation of parameters in structuring the MAUF. <lb/>The person-mean was estimated by 10% trimmed <lb/>mean of the direct preference measures so as to <lb/>minimize central tendency bias caused by outliers <lb/>[18]. Trimmed means of the VAS values and SG <lb/>utilities for the single symptom states (VAS values <lb/>only), corner symptom states and multi-symptom <lb/>states provided the basis of parameters to construct <lb/>the mathematical function. A power function was <lb/>used to establish the fitted disvalue-disutility rela <lb/>tionship (disvalue = 1 -value; disutility = 1 -util <lb/>ity) and the log function, In (1 -u) = ol [In (1 -v)] <lb/>where v equals to values and u equals to utilities. A <lb/>linear regression model with no intercept was esti <lb/>mated using the data of the five corner states and the <lb/>five multi-symptom states. The standard form for a <lb/>five-attribute multiplicative disutility function is <lb/>shown as follows: <lb/>0=(l/c) f[(l + CCj?j) -I <lb/>L/=i <lb/>l+c = PJ(l+cc/) j=l <lb/>D is the disutility index where the scale is 0.00 for <lb/>perfect health and 1.0 for the all-worst state. <lb/>Each ?j is the single attribute disutility function <lb/>for the attribute j on a scale where the best level <lb/>has a disutility of 0.00 and the worst level has a <lb/>disutility of 1.0, where c and Cj are the model <lb/>parameters. Each Cj is a scalar constant in con <lb/>junction with the corner state j that also contrib <lb/>utes to the weightings of the conditional single <lb/>attribute utilities. <lb/></body>

			<body>Psychometric evaluation <lb/>Psychometric evaluation of the Chinese-based <lb/>RSUI included test-retest reliability, discriminant <lb/>and convergent validity. Test-retest reliability <lb/>(stability) was estimated by the calculation of the <lb/>intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [19] which <lb/>reflects both degree of correspondence and agree <lb/>ment among ratings [20]. A coefficient of 0.70 is an <lb/>acceptable indicator of stability for a patient <lb/>reported outcome instrument [21]. An agreement <lb/>between the predicted (RSUI) and directly mea <lb/>sured (SG) utility scores was also tested with ICC. <lb/>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures were <lb/>utilized to test the ability of the RSUI to dis <lb/>criminate among different levels of disease severity <lb/>and between those who did and did not require <lb/>medications to control symptoms in the past <lb/>14 days. Inter-rater reliability in the severity rat <lb/>ings between the two physicians was assessed by <lb/>the calculation of ICC. Convergent validity was <lb/>examined Pearson product-moment correlations <lb/>between RSUI and SF-36 domain scores. A low <lb/>correlation was considered &lt; 0.35, and a moderate <lb/>correlation was considered in the range 0.35-0.50 <lb/>[22]. r-Tests were used to compare mean VAS <lb/>preferences and SG utility scores for the directly <lb/>measured states between the Chinese and US <lb/>samples. Mean RSUI scores were calculated based <lb/>on the Chinese-and US-based MAUF. The sig <lb/>nificant difference between the outcomes resulting <lb/>from the two functions within subjects was tested <lb/>by paired ?-test. The association between the two <lb/>outcomes was analyzed with Pearson product <lb/>moment correlation. Statistical significances were <lb/>determined by a/7-value of &lt;0.05. <lb/>Results <lb/>Of the 116 subjects who participated in the study, <lb/>only 112 (59 females and 53 males) were included <lb/>in the analysis because the SG interviews of 4 <lb/>subjects (3.5%) were of poor quality. Data quality <lb/>was determined by respondent self-assessment and <lb/>interviewer judgment. The mean age of the study <lb/>subjects was 37.6 ? 11.5 years (range 18-62 years). <lb/>About 18% (n = 21) of the participants achieved a <lb/>university degree. Four subjects (3.6%) had never <lb/>received formal education. The remainder of the <lb/>participants attained either primary (21.4%) or <lb/>secondary educational levels (56.3%). <lb/>Direct preference measures and MA UF <lb/>The 10% trimmed means (5% trimmed off of each <lb/>end of the distribution) of the direct VAS prefer <lb/>ences and SG utilities for the corner symptom <lb/>states and multiple symptom states are shown in <lb/>Table 2. All SG utility scores were higher than the <lb/>VAS values. Severe stuffy nose and severe runny <lb/>nose were rated worse than the other corner states <lb/>for both VAS preferences and SG utilities. <lb/>The regression model for estimating utilities <lb/>from VAS preferences resulted in a R2 of 0.979 and <lb/>an unstandardized regression coefficient, of 2.926. <lb/>This coefficient was used in the power function to <lb/>estimate utilities for the within attribute (symp <lb/>tom) levels (Table 1). <lb/>We then applied the standard form for a five <lb/>attribute disutility function. The multiplicative <lb/>model best fits the preference data, based on the <lb/>derived parameters c = -0.814, ci=0.40, c2 = 0.40, <lb/>c3 = 0.32, c4 = 0.32, c5 = 0.31, This resulted in a <lb/>multiplicative MAUF for the Chinese-based <lb/>RSUI =1.228 (Si x S2x S3x S4x S5)-0.228, <lb/>where RSUI is the derived utility for the symptom <lb/>states on a scale that the best symptom state (no <lb/>symptoms) has a score of 1 and the worst possible <lb/>symptom state (severe symptoms for 8-14 days) <lb/>has a score of 0; and Si is the score for the level on <lb/>symptom i.

Twenty-six percent of our subjects reported <lb/>improvement and 14.3% reported worsening over <lb/>a 2-week period. In the examination of test-retest <lb/>reliability, we only included those subjects (n = 66) <lb/>who reported more or less the same rhinitis status <lb/>when comparing with their condition at baseline. <lb/>The ICC, indicating the 2-week reproducibility of <lb/>the RSUI, was 0.71 (p&lt; 0.001). <lb/></body>

			<body>Validity <lb/>The direct utility measures and the derived RSUI <lb/>scores for the corner and multi-symptom states are <lb/>displayed in Table 2.

The standard deviations among the <lb/>differences for the corner states and multi-symp <lb/>tom states were 0.06 and 0.04, respectively. The <lb/>agreement between the predicted RSUI and di <lb/>rectly measured SG utility scores for the multi <lb/>symptom states was high (ICC = 0.98, p&lt; 0.001). <lb/>Using the Chinese-based MAUF in scoring <lb/>rhinitis symptoms, the generated RSUI mean score <lb/>for the study group was 0.70 (SD = 0.22) and the <lb/>median score was 0.76. RSUI scores did not sig <lb/>nificantly vary by gender (p = 0.064) or age <lb/>{p = 0.703). Moreover, no significant correlations <lb/>were detected between RSUI scores and years <lb/>experiencing rhinitis {p = 0.723) nor age of onset of <lb/>rhinitis {p = 0.591). Table 4 summarizes the mean <lb/>RSUI scores by physician-rated and patient self <lb/>rated severity in rhinitis status. There was a fairly <lb/>strong association between the physician-rated <lb/>and patient self-rated severity scores (r = 0.65, <lb/>p&lt; 0.001). Mean RSUI scores varied significantly <lb/>by both physician-rated {p&lt; 0.001) and patient <lb/>rated severity of rhinitis symptoms (/?&lt; 0.001). <lb/>Inter-rater agreement between the two physician <lb/>ratings was only moderate (ICC = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001). <lb/>Significant discrimination properties in the RSUI <lb/>were also detected based on the two independent <lb/>physician-ratings (/? = 0.004 and p&lt; 0.001, respec <lb/>tively). The RSUI scores were correlated with the <lb/>patient self-rated VAS scores for their current <lb/>rhinitis status (r = 0.59, /?&lt;0.001). Mean RSUI <lb/>scores differentiated between the patients who did <lb/>(mean RSUI = 0.68) and did not require medica <lb/>tions (mean RSUI = 0.78) to control symptoms in <lb/>the past 2 weeks (/? = 0.031). <lb/>In the examination of convergent validity, there <lb/>were weak to moderate correlations between RSUI <lb/>and the majority of the SF-36 dimensions. Signif <lb/>icant correlations were detected between RSUI <lb/>and bodily pain (r = 0.25, p = 0.009), general health <lb/>(r = 0.37, /&gt;&lt;0.001), vitality (r = 0.27, p = 0.003), <lb/>social functioning (r = 0.25, p = 0.009), role emo <lb/>tional (r = 0.19, p = 0.041), and mental health <lb/>(r = 0.20, p = 0.035). No significant correlations <lb/>were observed between the RSUI and physical <lb/>functioning (p = 0.298) or role physical score <lb/>(p = 0.154). <lb/>Comparison between Chinese-and US-based <lb/>preferences and RSUI scores <lb/>The directly measured VAS preferences and SG <lb/>utilities for the five corner states and the five multi <lb/>symptom states were compared between the <lb/>Chinese and US samples. There were statistically <lb/>significant differences in mean VAS preference <lb/>scores for all of these health states (all p &lt; 0.05; not <lb/>shown). The differences ranged from 0.07 to 0.25 <lb/>points. For the SG utilities, there were statistically <lb/>significant mean differences between all of the <lb/>Table 3.

Differences in SG utilities ranged from <lb/>0.02 to 0.14. <lb/>When the US-based MAUF [10] was used to <lb/>score rhinitis symptoms for the Chinese subjects in <lb/>the current study, the mean RSUI score was lower, <lb/>0.63 (SD = 0.21). There was a statistically signifi <lb/>cant mean difference of 0.07 (range from -0.06 to <lb/>0.23; p&lt; 0.001) when compared to the RSUI <lb/>scores based on the Chinese MAUF. A highly <lb/>significant correlation was observed between the <lb/>RSUI scores from the US-based and Chinese <lb/>based functions (r = 0.96, p&lt; 0.001), and the ICC <lb/>was 0.90 (p&lt; 0.001). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>This study developed the RSUI scoring system <lb/>based on patient preferences from a Chinese Hong <lb/>Kong sample. Few study subjects were unable to <lb/>complete the utility assessment interview. The de <lb/>rived RSUI scores appeared to have slightly un <lb/>der-predicted the directly measured utilities as <lb/>many of the MAUF-SG differences were negative. <lb/>The differences however were very minimal. Pre <lb/>dictive validity of the MAUF model should be <lb/>evaluated with the use of inter-survey groups in <lb/>future research. In the evaluation of reliability, the <lb/>Chinese RSUI exhibited good reproducibility over <lb/>2 weeks in subjects that remained clinically stable <lb/>(based on self-reports). In the validity evaluation, <lb/>we demonstrated that the RSUI scores varied <lb/>significantly by rhinitis-related severity rated by <lb/>both clinicians and patients. In all cases, patients <lb/>reporting more severe rhinitis status also had sig <lb/>nificantly lower (worse) RSUI scores compared to <lb/>those with less severe rhinitis. The consistency in <lb/>association between rhinitis severities rated by <lb/>patients and physicians provides strong supportive <lb/>evidence for the validity of the RSUI scores. The <lb/>RSUI scores also were significantly worse in pa <lb/>tients who required medication therapy to control <lb/>their rhinitis symptoms, providing additional <lb/>supportive evidence for validity. <lb/>There are few studies comparing the preferences <lb/>of Asian and Western subjects for different health <lb/>states. Furlong and colleagues [23] examined the <lb/>results from the literature in regard to the MAUFs <lb/>constructed for the generic instruments between <lb/>different Western countries and concluded that <lb/>these functions were fairly similar. However, it is <lb/>less certain that this conclusion can be generalized <lb/>to Asian countries. In this article, we compared the <lb/>directly measured preference scores between the <lb/>US and Hong Kong samples and found significant <lb/>differences in the VAS and SG scores. There may <lb/>be cultural differences between the US and Chinese <lb/>respondents, as well as differences in demographic <lb/>and clinical characteristics. For example, while the <lb/>age and gender distributions were similar between <lb/>the two samples, the US subjects were more edu <lb/>cated. Forty-four percent of the US subjects held a <lb/>university degree (and 32% had some college) <lb/>compared with 18% of the Chinese sample. The <lb/>differences in the preference scores could also be <lb/>due to the variations between the preference <lb/>measuring methods, e.g. in-person interviews vs. <lb/>computer-interactive interviews. We tried to min <lb/>imize the differences between the two modes of <lb/>administration by simulating Revicki et al.&apos;s tra <lb/>ditional assessment method [10] in the warm up <lb/>exercises. <lb/></body>

			<body>For the VAS preference ratings of corner states, <lb/>Chinese subjects consistently rated the states as 9 <lb/>12% more preferable than the US subjects. For the <lb/>SG utilities, the scores obtained from the Chinese <lb/>and US populations varied and differed substan <lb/>tially for the state involving itchy-watery eyes. <lb/>These observed difference in the scoring patterns <lb/>of the five corner states in SG utilities may be due <lb/>to geographic variations in disease characteristics, <lb/>where the US subjects rated itchy-watery eyes as <lb/>worse and the Chinese rated stuffy nose and runny <lb/>nose as worse. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is com <lb/>monly seen in the US [9, 24] and it usually induces <lb/>relatively more ocular symptoms especially during <lb/>the pollen season [6, 25, 26]. Cases of seasonal <lb/>allergic rhinitis are rarely seen in Hong Kong. <lb/>Instead, perennial allergic rhinitis mostly induced <lb/>by house dust mite is common [27]. In the Hong <lb/>Kong clinical experience, the most frequent com <lb/>plaints from patients are nasal obstruction and <lb/>runny nose. This is consistent with the patterns of <lb/>SG utilities seen in this study. In the current study, <lb/>30% of our subjects did not have any eye-related <lb/>problems, and this is the highest free-of-symptom <lb/>ratio among all other symptoms (Table 5). <lb/>Therefore, because of the lower prevalence of <lb/>itchy-watery eyes in these patients, they may be of <lb/>less concern. <lb/>The diversity of patient preferences in SG mea <lb/>sures contributed to the different weightings for <lb/>the utility-scoring functions between the two cul <lb/>tures. The MAUF for the Chinese RSUI was <lb/>somewhat different from that derived based on the <lb/>original US study sample. This resulted in a sig <lb/>nificant difference in the rhinitis outcome in the <lb/>Chinese subjects between using the US-and Chi <lb/>nese-based RSUI. Our findings revealed that use <lb/>of the US-based scoring algorithm would overes <lb/>timate the severity of rhinitis outcomes for Chinese <lb/>subjects. Based on the US RSUI calculation, the <lb/>majority of our subjects (89%) had comparatively <lb/>worse scores, while 9% of the study group (n= 10) <lb/>had better rhinitis scores. It was observed that <lb/>these 10 patients either reported no eye-related <lb/>symptoms (n = 5) or very mild itchy-watery eyes <lb/>(n = 5). Results indicated that subjects with mod <lb/>erate or severe itchy-watery eyes might have been <lb/>overestimated as more severe on their overall rhi <lb/>nitis index. <lb/>In conclusion, the present study results support <lb/>the reliability and validity of the Chinese-based <lb/>RSUI for the use in the Chinese population. The <lb/>RSUI allows the incorporation of patient prefer <lb/>ences into outcome measurements of rhinitis <lb/>symptoms. The developed MAUF appears to <lb/>reflect directly assessed preferences for rhinitis <lb/>related health states. This study also provides some <lb/>preliminary evidence that MAUFs and preferences <lb/>may vary between US and Asian countries. <lb/>Additional research is needed to examine the nat <lb/>ure and extent of differences in preferences for <lb/>different health states between Asian and Western <lb/>cultures. In the present study, we are not able to <lb/>rule out whether or not the differences between the <lb/>Chinese-and US-based RSUI are associated with <lb/>subject characteristics or different preference <lb/>measurement methods. However, we have ob <lb/>served that patient preferences seem to be affected <lb/>by geographical variations in disease characteris <lb/>tics. Therefore, caution should be taken before the <lb/>application of a disease-specific preference func <lb/>tion from another country. Our results suggested <lb/>that use of the US-based preference function might <lb/>bias the measurement of rhinitis outcomes in the <lb/>Chinese. Based on this study, there is evidence that <lb/>the Chinese RSUI is reproducible and valid. Fur <lb/>ther research is needed to demonstrate the pre <lb/>dictive validity and responsiveness of the RSUI to <lb/>clinically meaningful changes in rhinitis status. <lb/>The RSUI may be useful as a preference-weighted <lb/>outcome measure for clinical and economic studies <lb/>comparing different rhinitis treatments. <lb/>Table 5.
