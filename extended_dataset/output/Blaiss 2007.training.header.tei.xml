	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal<lb/> obstruction. Although the incidence of AR has been increasing, the reported prevalence of AR differs among surveys. Allergies<lb/> in America was a comprehensive national survey that included 2500 adults diagnosed with AR and 400 healthcare<lb/> practitioners who treat AR. Participants were interviewed about the burden of AR and comorbid conditions and the effect of<lb/> AR on productivity and quality of life. Approximately 43% of nasal allergy sufferers reported that their nasal allergies were<lb/> seasonal, and 56% indicated that their allergies were persistent throughout the year. Seasonal allergies were worse during the<lb/> spring and fall, as reported by 56 and 45% of sufferers, respectively. Nasal congestion was ranked as the most common symptom<lb/> experienced by patients daily or on most days during the worst month for nasal allergies. Patients and healthcare providers<lb/> indicated that nasal congestion was the most bothersome symptom of AR. Asthma was diagnosed in 20% of patients with AR.<lb/> Nasal allergy sufferers and healthcare providers indicated that nasal allergies affected productivity, led to missed workdays, and<lb/> had a negative effect on patient quality of life. Patients and healthcare professionals report that symptoms of AR are bothersome.<lb/> Effective treatment options for nasal symptoms of AR may decrease the burden of illness and improve patient productivity and<lb/> quality of life.<lb/></div>
