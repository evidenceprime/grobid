Boyle, PhD i San Diego and <lb/>Los Angeles, Calif, Memphis, Tenn, La Crosse, Wis, Hyannis, Mass, Lafayette, Ind, Little Rock, Ark, Florham Park, NJ, and New York, NY <lb/>Allergic rhinitis (AR), a chronic inflammatory disease of the <lb/>upper airway, is one of the most common chronic diseases in the <lb/>United States and is estimated to affect up to 60 million people. <lb/>Pediatric Allergies in America is the largest and most <lb/>comprehensive survey to date of pediatric patients and parents of <lb/>patients with allergy, as well as health care providers (HCPs), <lb/>regarding AR in children and its treatment. The goals of the <lb/>survey were to determine the prevalence of AR in the US <lb/>pediatric population and to collect information on what effect the <lb/>condition has on patients in terms of symptom burden, quality of <lb/>life, productivity, disease management, and pharmacologic <lb/>treatment. This national survey screened 35,757 households to <lb/>identify 500 children with HCP-diagnosed nasal allergies and 504 <lb/>children without nasal allergies who were between the ages of 4 <lb/>and 17 years. Parents of young children, as well as children 10 to <lb/>17 years of age, were questioned about the condition and its <lb/>treatment. In parallel, 501 HCPs were interviewed. This survey <lb/>has captured previously unavailable data on the prevalence of <lb/>nasal allergies and their most common and most bothersome <lb/>symptoms, on the effect of nasal allergies on the quality of life of <lb/>children, and on medication use, including both over-the-counter <lb/>and prescription medications, and has identified factors affecting <lb/>satisfaction with treatment. The Pediatric Allergies in America <lb/>survey also identifies distinct areas for improvement in the <lb/>management of AR in children. In fact, based on the results of this <lb/>survey, it appears that HCPs overestimate patients&apos; and parents&apos; <lb/>satisfaction with disease management and the benefit of <lb/>medications used for the treatment of nasal allergies in children. <lb/>Findings from this national survey have identified important <lb/>challenges to the management of AR, suggesting that its burden <lb/>on children in the United States has been significantly <lb/>underestimated.

Dr <lb/>Wingertzahn has a solid foundation in ethical research and has authored numerous <lb/>manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals within the area of allergy. He was not a member <lb/>of the core writing committee but was a reviewer of the supplement.

			<body>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the <lb/>upper airways that is characterized by the symptoms of nasal <lb/>congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal itching. AR is esti-<lb/>mated to affect approximately 60 million people in the United <lb/>States, and its prevalence is increasing. 1-3 The Agency for Health-<lb/>care Research and Quality estimates the prevalence of AR in <lb/>adults to be between 10% and 30%, and several studies have es-<lb/>timated the prevalence of AR in children to be closer to 40%. 4-6 <lb/>Allergies in America, a recent survey of adults with nasal allergy <lb/>in the United States, estimates that 1 (14%) in 7 adults is diag-<lb/>nosed by a health care practitioner with AR, nasal allergies, or <lb/>&apos;&apos;hay fever.&apos;&apos; 7,8 Most (80%) individuals develop symptoms of <lb/>AR before 20 years of age, with 40% of patients becoming symp-<lb/>tomatic by age 6 years. 9 <lb/>AR can be categorized as seasonal or perennial depending on <lb/>allergen sensitivity. Among US adults diagnosed with AR, 40% <lb/>have perennial AR, and 20% have seasonal AR; an additional <lb/>40% have perennial AR with seasonal flare-ups. 9 It is noteworthy <lb/>that approximately 50% of adults with AR report that their symp-<lb/>toms last for more than 4 months of the year and that 20% report <lb/>symptoms for more than 9 months. 2 <lb/>Although AR can be associated with significant morbidity, its <lb/>effects are not limited to its physical symptoms. Often, the true <lb/>effect of this disease involves the profound consequences it <lb/>imposes on the patient&apos;s quality of life (QoL), emotional well-<lb/>being, productivity, and cognitive functioning. Many of these <lb/>health-related QoL issues appear to stem, in part, from sleep <lb/>disturbances associated with AR. 2 In addition to the physical and <lb/>emotional toll that AR elicits in patients, it also places a consid-<lb/>erable economic burden on the US health care system. This bur-<lb/>den includes both direct costs to patients and insurance providers <lb/>and indirect costs that include patient absenteeism (missed days at <lb/>work/school) and presenteeism (decreased productivity at work/ <lb/>school). 2 <lb/>Although treatment of AR often begins with environmental <lb/>control to reduce allergen exposure, pharmacologic intervention <lb/>is often required for control of moderate-to-severe symptoms. <lb/>Intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) sprays are generally considered <lb/>the gold-standard pharmacotherapy for AR in both adults and <lb/>children. 10 Over-the-counter (OTC), as well as prescription, oral <lb/>and intranasal antihistamines, oral and topical decongestants, and <lb/>leukotriene receptor antagonists are also commonly used pharma-<lb/>cotherapies in both adult and pediatric patient populations. 1 Al-<lb/>though these medications can be effective at controlling the <lb/>symptoms of nasal allergies, they can be associated with adverse <lb/>effects, such as local epistaxis, nasal dryness, and irritation from <lb/>intranasal medications and drowsiness from antihistamines. 1,11,12 <lb/>The systemic effects of INCSs are of particular concern in chil-<lb/>dren because of the absence of weight-based dosing, as well as re-<lb/>ports of cortisol suppression and growth slowing during treatment <lb/>with INCSs. 13-16 In addition, currently available INCSs and other <lb/>prescription nasal sprays might not provide complete or long-<lb/>term symptom relief in children. Limitations in the extent and <lb/>duration of action of INCSs or other prescription nasal sprays <lb/>might decrease patient satisfaction with treatment, thereby reduc-<lb/>ing adherence. <lb/>Oral and intranasal antihistamines, although clinically effec-<lb/>tive for the treatment of both seasonal and perennial AR as a <lb/>monotherapy, are generally considered to be less effective than <lb/>INCSs for control of nasal allergy symptoms; as a result, <lb/>antihistamines are frequently paired with either a decongestant <lb/>or leukotriene receptor antagonist to improve their efficacy. 17,18 <lb/>In contrast, topical decongestants are very effective for improving <lb/>nasal congestion but are inappropriate for daily use because of the <lb/>potential for rebound of symptoms (rhinitis medicamentosa). 17 <lb/>Much of the data available in the adult literature regarding <lb/>prevalence, burden, and QoL effects of AR have not been <lb/>available with regard to children. Information regarding how <lb/>side effects from treatment affect the daily lives of children and <lb/>their adherence to medication is not known. Therefore the <lb/>Pediatric Allergies in America national survey was conducted <lb/>to gain insights into the prevalence of AR in children, its <lb/>symptoms, its effect on QoL, its comorbidities, the use of OTC <lb/>and prescription treatments, patient satisfaction with symptom <lb/>relief from treatment, and the side effects from AR treatment and <lb/>their role in the adherence and discontinuation of AR treatment in <lb/>children. Because current practice guidelines for AR and AR with <lb/>comorbid asthma recommend the use of INCSs as first-line agents <lb/>over other approved therapies, this supplement places an <lb/>emphasis on INCSs and nasal sprays in general when reporting <lb/>patient satisfaction with symptom relief, side effects of treatment, <lb/>and treatment adherence and discontinuation rates (Allergic <lb/>Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma Guidelines; 2008 Practice <lb/>Parameters). <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Survey design <lb/>Pediatric Allergies in America, a comprehensive national telephone <lb/>screening of 35,757 households in the United States, was conducted to <lb/>identify subjects with nasal allergy between 4 and 17 years of age. This <lb/>national survey was designed to use a credible data-collection approach to <lb/>determine the prevalence of AR in the US pediatric population. This survey <lb/>interviewed the parents of children 4 through 9 years of age and both the <lb/>parents and children 10 years of age and older and collected information on <lb/>what this condition means to those who have it in terms of morbidity and <lb/>management of the disease. <lb/>During the interviews, an adult member of each household was asked to <lb/>report the number of children in the household between 4 and 17 years of age <lb/>who had been diagnosed with AR, nasal allergies, or &apos;&apos;hay fever.&apos;&apos; The survey <lb/>identified 500 children who were diagnosed with AR by a health care provider <lb/>(HCP) and who had symptoms and had taken medication in the previous 12 <lb/>months. A comparison group of 504 children without nasal allergies was also <lb/>identified (Table I). The calculation of overall prevalence of the disease in <lb/>children was based on all children who were reported by parents to have <lb/>been diagnosed with nasal allergies of all households surveyed that had chil-<lb/>dren younger than 18 years. All other calculations were based on children with <lb/>(n 5 500) and without (n 5 504) nasal allergies, as specified above. <lb/>The telephone survey lasted an average of 36 minutes (269 questions) in the <lb/>AR parent group and 18 minutes (123 questions) in the allergy-free parent <lb/>group. When parents consented, children 10 to 17 years of age responded to a <lb/></body>

			<body>subset of up to 98 questions in addition to the parents&apos; responses. Where <lb/>relevant (ie, outcomes different), data from parents&apos; responses are reported <lb/>separately from those of the children&apos;s responses. The average interview <lb/>length of 36 minutes at a rate of approximately 4 questions per minute meant <lb/>that a respondent answered about 140 questions. However, many of the <lb/>questions were contingent on a gatekeeper question (eg, &apos;&apos;Have you taken an <lb/>OTC medication for your AR in the past 4 weeks?&apos;&apos;), and subsequent questions <lb/>would only be asked of those who answered in the affirmative. Hence <lb/>respondents were only asked the subset of all possible questions that were <lb/>appropriate to their condition and treatment. <lb/>A parallel survey was conducted among 501 HCPs, including 100 <lb/>physicians in family practice, 101 allergists, 100 otolaryngologists, and <lb/>100 pediatricians, as well as 50 nurse practitioners (NPs) and 50 physician <lb/>assistants (PAs), to determine HCP&apos;s perspectives on children&apos;s nasal allergies <lb/>and their treatment. Physician survey participants were drawn as probability <lb/>samples from the American Medical Association and the American Osteo-<lb/>pathic Association Master List of physicians in the United States. The samples <lb/>were restricted to physicians in 4 specialty strata who were in active practice <lb/>and in direct patient care in an outpatient setting. The NP sample was drawn <lb/>from state licensing board lists, and the PA sample was drawn from the <lb/>membership list of the American Academy of Physician Assistants. HCP <lb/>interviews were approximately 20 minutes in length and were composed of 76 <lb/>questions. Physician respondents were compensated $50, and NPs and <lb/>physician assistants were compensated $25 for their time. Parents were not <lb/>compensated; however, children aged 10 to 17 years who agreed to participate <lb/>in a follow-up questionnaire were compensated $10. <lb/>Schulman, Ronca and Bucuvalas, Inc, a national public opinion research <lb/>organization and leading physician experts in the field of AR, collaborated to <lb/>develop the Pediatric Allergies in America questionnaire. Survey questions <lb/>were developed through analysis of the relevant literature and identification of <lb/>questions used to study similar diseases in other accepted health surveys, <lb/>including the adult Allergies in America survey conducted in January 2006. 7 <lb/>The AR patient questionnaire focused on general health, AR triggers, AR <lb/>symptoms, the effects of allergies on QoL and productivity, AR comorbidities, <lb/>and the effectiveness and side effects of nasal allergy medications in children. <lb/>Statistics <lb/>The surveys were conducted by Schulman, Ronca and Bucuvalas, Inc, <lb/>between March and April 2007. Sampling was conducted by using list-<lb/>assisted random-digit dialing within a geographically stratified design for the <lb/>US household population. List-assisted random-digit dialing samples are <lb/>based on a sampling frame that includes all hundred-series telephone banks <lb/>(eg, 123-456-78xx) with listed telephone numbers to which 2-digit random-<lb/>ized numbers are appended to complete a full telephone number. Although the <lb/>restriction of the sampling frame to banks with listed numbers excludes an <lb/>estimated 4% of US households with landlines, it permits an efficient way to <lb/>generate a simple random sample of telephone numbers. <lb/>For a simple random sampling of 500 respondents (ie, the sample of <lb/>children with AR and the sample of children without AR), the maximum <lb/>expected sampling error would be 6 4.4% at the 95% CI. For the comparisons <lb/>between the samples of children with allergies and children without allergies, <lb/>the maximum expected pooled error would be 6 6.2% (95% CI). For the <lb/>survey of HCPs, in which the simple random sample consisted of 100 <lb/>respondents (eg, pediatricians), the maximum expected sampling error would <lb/>be 6 9.8% (95% CI). This survey approach allowed for a relevant and <lb/>statistically accurate reflection of parents&apos; and physicians&apos; perspectives on the <lb/>management of AR in the 4-to 17-year-old population of US subjects with <lb/>allergy. <lb/>Where appropriate, the comparisons of responses by parents of children <lb/>with nasal allergies and parents of children without nasal allergies were <lb/>conducted by means of ANOVA (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC), and P values <lb/>were reported. However, surveys such as the Pediatric Allergies in America <lb/>telephone survey tend to obtain responses and opinions that cannot be formally <lb/>verified. Much like the analysis of reported adverse events that occur in a clin-<lb/>ical trial, results from surveys are typically reported by using descriptive mea-<lb/>sures. Therefore except where noted, most survey results have been reported <lb/>descriptively. <lb/>Survey questions <lb/>The questions in the patient survey relevant to this publication are detailed <lb/>by chapter in Appendix 1. <lb/>PREVALENCE OF PEDIATRIC ALLERGIC RHINITIS <lb/>Although AR is currently estimated to affect approximately 60 <lb/>million people in the United States and prevalence is increasing, it <lb/>is still considered by many to be a nuisance condition of <lb/>childhood rather than a serious disease. 1-3 Many children become <lb/>symptomatic and are given diagnoses of AR by age 6 years; 80% <lb/>of all individuals with AR have symptoms before age 20 years. 9 <lb/>According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, <lb/>the self-reported prevalence of AR in adults is estimated to be be-<lb/>tween 10% and 30%, whereas in children numerous studies esti-<lb/>mate the prevalence of AR to be nearer to 40%. 4-6 Allergies in <lb/>America, a recent survey of subjects with nasal allergy in the <lb/>United States, estimates that 1 (14%) in 7 adults has a physician&apos;s <lb/>diagnosis of AR, nasal allergies, or hay fever. 7 <lb/>Similar to the prevalence rate observed in Allergies in America <lb/>for US adults, the Pediatric Allergies in America survey found <lb/>that 13% of children had an HCP-confirmed diagnosis of AR and <lb/>were symptomatic during the year before the survey. This value <lb/>was based on parents&apos; responses that of the 8,119 households <lb/>surveyed with children 18 years of age or younger, 1,068 children <lb/>had been diagnosed with nasal allergies. With the exception of <lb/>this calculation of prevalence, subsequent analyses were con-<lb/>ducted based on 500 children with nasal allergies and 504 <lb/>children without nasal allergies, as noted in the Methods section. <lb/>These estimates of symptomatic AR in children fall at the lower <lb/>end of previous estimates of AR in the US pediatric population <lb/>(10% to 40%). 4-6 Among households having children diagnosed <lb/>with AR, 80% of parents reported that their children had used <lb/>medication to control nasal allergy symptoms during the previous <lb/>12 months.

			<body>(43%) were made by the child&apos;s pediatrician (Fig 1, B). Interest-<lb/>ingly, the pediatricians surveyed estimated that among 95 patients <lb/>(4-17 years of age) seen on average each week (Fig 1, C), 24% (n <lb/>5 23) of patients had AR. These physician estimates of AR prev-<lb/>alence are similar to those reported by family practice physicians <lb/>(29%), as well as by NPs and PAs (27%). Ear, nose, and throat <lb/>specialists estimated that 44% of their patients 4 to 17 years of <lb/>age had AR; allergists estimated that 67% of patients seen each <lb/>week had AR (Fig 1, D). Although pediatricians see more pa-<lb/>tients, make more AR diagnoses, and provide the bulk of the gen-<lb/>eral management and treatment of pediatric AR, only 44% <lb/>reported that they are familiar with professional guidelines for <lb/>the diagnosis and management of nasal allergies (Fig 1, E). <lb/>The survey found that, with the exception of allergists, few <lb/>HCPs routinely use skin or blood tests to confirm a diagnosis of <lb/>AR. In order of decreasing frequency of diagnostic test use, <lb/>allergists (99%); ear, nose, and throat specialists (28%); NPs/PAs <lb/>(12%); and pediatricians and family practitioners (7%) say they <lb/>perform skin tests all or most of the time. Even fewer (17%) <lb/>HCPs use blood tests to confirm an AR diagnosis. Despite the <lb/>relatively low percentage of HCPs who reported that they <lb/>routinely used diagnostic tests to confirm AR, 24% of parents <lb/>said that their child with nasal allergies had a skin test, 11% said <lb/>that their child had a blood test, and 13% said that their child had <lb/>both to confirm a diagnosis of AR (Fig 2). <lb/>Nasal allergies are commonly diagnosed as either seasonal or <lb/>perennial, although many patients had both types of allergy <lb/>triggers. When asked whether their nasal allergies were seasonal <lb/>or persisted throughout the year, 313 (62%) parents reported that <lb/>their children&apos;s allergies were seasonal only, whereas 183 (37%) <lb/>indicated that their children&apos;s allergies occurred throughout the <lb/>year (Fig 3, A). Similarly, most (54%) HCPs agreed that their pe-<lb/>diatric patients primarily had seasonal rather than perennial aller-<lb/>gies. Among parents of patients who reported seasonal AR, 76% <lb/>said that their child&apos;s allergies were worse during the spring sea-<lb/>son, whereas 34% reported that their children&apos;s allergies were <lb/>worse during the fall season (multiple answers were permitted; <lb/>Fig 3, B). More parents report that their children&apos;s nasal allergy <lb/>symptoms were worse outside (44%) rather than inside (3%), al-<lb/>though the remaining 52% of parents reported that the severity of <lb/>their children&apos;s allergies was about the same inside and outside <lb/>(Fig 3, C). <lb/>Triggers of nasal symptoms can be divided into allergic and <lb/>nonallergic types, and most patients reported multiple sensitiv-<lb/>ities. In keeping with the high percentage of seasonal allergies <lb/>reported, the most common triggers of nasal symptoms in the <lb/>allergic children were pollen (54%; including grass [25%], as <lb/>well as tree and weed allergens), dust (29%), and animal dander <lb/>(15%). In addition, nonallergic triggers, such as weather (19%), <lb/>fumes and odors (7%), and exercise (6%), are commonly reported <lb/>(Fig 3, D). <lb/>The results of the Pediatric Allergies in America and Allergies <lb/>in America questionnaires indicate that diagnosed nasal allergies <lb/>are equally prevalent in children and adults in the United States; <lb/>however, because they do not include adults or children without a <lb/>formal HCP-confirmed diagnosis of AR, these surveys likely <lb/>underreport the overall population prevalence of the disease. Most <lb/>diagnoses in children are made by a pediatrician who is likely also <lb/>the child&apos;s primary care physician. Most parents and physicians <lb/>report that children appear to have seasonal allergies, although <lb/>many also have perennial allergies. In contrast, the Allergies in <lb/>America survey of US adults found that most adults had perennial <lb/>allergies, with a slightly lower prevalence of seasonal allergies. <lb/>When seasonal exacerbations occurred in children with AR, the <lb/>majority of parents reported that their child&apos;s worst allergy <lb/>symptoms occurred during the spring season, followed by fall. <lb/>Adults also reported that spring, followed by fall, was the worst <lb/>time of year for allergy symptoms. <lb/>SYMPTOMS OF PEDIATRIC AR <lb/>AR is characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, repeated <lb/>sneezing, and nasal itching, common symptoms brought on by the <lb/>body&apos;s immunologic inflammatory response to allergen expo-<lb/>sure. 19-22 Ocular symptoms, such as eye itching, tearing, redness, <lb/>and lid puffiness, collectively referred to as allergic conjunctivitis, <lb/>are also common symptoms of AR. 23 <lb/>Because the types of allergy symptoms experienced by chil-<lb/>dren often vary in frequency, parents were asked which of 12 <lb/>common allergy symptoms were experienced by their children <lb/>during the worst 1-month period in the previous year. The single <lb/>most frequently experienced nasal allergy symptom reported by <lb/>parents was nasal congestion or a stuffy nose (52%), which was <lb/>said to occur either every day (25%) or most days (27%) each <lb/>week during their children&apos;s worst month for allergy symptoms. <lb/>Repeated sneezing was also reported by nearly half (46%) of <lb/>parents as occurring every day or most days during their child&apos;s <lb/>worst allergy month. One third of parents reported runny nose <lb/>(34%) and watering eyes (34%) as occurring every day or most <lb/>days of their child&apos;s worst allergy month. In addition, more than <lb/></body>

			<body>1 in 4 parents stated that symptoms such as postnasal drip, red and <lb/>itching eyes, and nasal itching affected their children on all or <lb/>most days during the worst month in the previous year. Although <lb/>less commonly reported as occurring every day or most days, dry <lb/>cough, sleep disturbance, headache, facial pain, and ear pain were <lb/>also reported as common symptoms during children&apos;s worst <lb/>month for nasal allergy symptoms (Fig 4, A). <lb/>Parents were also asked how bothersome specific symptoms of <lb/>nasal allergies were for their children during nasal allergy flares. <lb/>In addition to being the most frequently described symptom of <lb/>nasal allergies, nasal congestion was also considered by parents to <lb/>be a bothersome symptom experienced by their children. Three in <lb/>4 parents reported nasal congestion as either extremely (32%) or <lb/>moderately (43%) bothersome during their children&apos;s nasal <lb/>allergy attacks. Postnasal drip (70%) and runny nose (65%) <lb/>were also reported as extremely or moderately bothersome <lb/>symptoms. Many parents reported headache, nasal itching, and <lb/>ear pain, as well as red, itching eyes, to be extremely or <lb/>moderately bothersome. Facial pain, dry cough, repeated sneez-<lb/>ing, and watering eyes were considered by at least half of all <lb/>parents to be the least bothersome symptoms of nasal allergies <lb/>(Fig 4, B). <lb/>Parents (88%) who reported their children&apos;s symptoms as being <lb/>either extremely or moderately bothersome were also asked <lb/>which symptoms were most bothersome to their child. Most <lb/>(27%) parents identified nasal congestion or stuffed-up nose as <lb/>the most bothersome symptom, whereas headache (13%) and <lb/>runny nose (12%) were the next most common replies. Dry cough, <lb/>red, itching eyes, postnasal drip, and repeated sneezing were less <lb/>commonly described as the most bothersome nasal allergy <lb/>symptoms. Although frequently considered to be bothersome, <lb/>symptoms of nasal allergies, such as watering eyes, nasal itching, <lb/>ear pain, and facial pain, were only infrequently considered by <lb/>parents to be the most bothersome symptom of their children&apos;s <lb/>nasal allergies (Fig 4, C). <lb/>In addition to parental responses, children 10 to 17 years of age <lb/>were asked which nasal allergy symptoms they experienced every <lb/>day or most days during their worst allergy month in the past year. <lb/>Nasal congestion or stuffed-up nose (39%), repeated sneezing <lb/>(36%), runny nose (35%), and watering eyes (20%) were <lb/>frequently reported as occurring either every day or on most <lb/>days of the worst month. A comparison of parents&apos; and children&apos;s <lb/>responses for symptoms occurring either every day or on most <lb/>days of the worst month of allergy symptoms indicates that either <lb/>parents overestimate the frequency of most nasal allergy <lb/>symptoms in their children or that children underreport the <lb/>frequency of their symptoms (Fig 5, A). <lb/>Although there were some discrepancies between parents&apos; and <lb/>children&apos;s responses for the frequency of nasal allergies, parental <lb/>reports of bothersome nasal allergy symptoms were generally in <lb/>agreement with children&apos;s views regarding allergy symptoms <lb/>considered extremely or moderately bothersome. During nasal <lb/>allergy attacks, the most bothersome symptoms of nasal allergies <lb/>reported by children were nasal congestion (26%), headache <lb/>(17%), runny nose (12%), and repeated sneezing (11%; Fig 5, B). <lb/>Additionally, nasal congestion, postnasal drip, headache, and <lb/>runny nose were consistently rated as being either extremely or <lb/>moderately bothersome by 60% of parents and children. <lb/>HCPs were also asked to rank the nasal allergy symptoms that <lb/>were among the most bothersome to their pediatric patients <lb/>(multiple answers were permitted). Like parents and children, the <lb/>majority of HCPs considered nasal congestion (91%) to be one of <lb/>the most bothersome symptoms of nasal allergies. Additionally, <lb/>runny nose (72%) and postnasal drip (67%) were reported as being <lb/>among the symptoms that are most bothersome to their pediatric <lb/>patients. Watery and red itchy eyes were also considered the most <lb/>bothersome symptoms by approximately half of all practitioners <lb/>(Fig 5, C). Regardless of symptom category, the vast majority <lb/>(86%) of HCPs indicated that their patients&apos; symptoms were mod-<lb/>erately or extremely bothersome; a further 67% of practitioners <lb/>reported that their pediatric patients experienced symptoms that <lb/>were moderate to severe in intensity during nasal allergy attacks. <lb/>Nasal allergy symptoms have a profound effect on the lives of <lb/>both children and adults. This survey identified nasal congestion, <lb/>or stuffy nose, as both the most frequent and the most bothersome <lb/>symptom of allergies in children, as reported by parents, patients, <lb/>and physicians. Nasal congestion was considered moderately or <lb/>extremely bothersome by more than 3 in 4 parents and 2 in 3 <lb/>children with nasal allergies. <lb/>These results are similar to findings in the Allergies in America <lb/>survey of US adults that helped establish that although children <lb/>and adults had the same disease, they reported subtle differences <lb/>in the frequency and severity of nasal allergy symptoms. AR <lb/>symptoms are generally localized to the nose, nasal and oral <lb/>pharynx, eyes, sinuses, and ears. Given the differences in <lb/>anatomic structure (eg, Eustachian tube length and smaller lumen <lb/>size of the nares) observed in young children compared with older <lb/>children and adults, it is not surprising that the frequency and <lb/>severity of symptoms should vary slightly between the 2 popu-<lb/>lations. For instance, more children than adults reported facial <lb/>pain and ear pain as being moderately to extremely bothersome. <lb/>Nasal congestion in the smaller airway lumens in children might <lb/>result in the retention of fluids and increased pain in the ears and <lb/>paranasal sinuses. In contrast, the increased drainage of mucus in <lb/>adults compared with smaller children can manifest as postnasal <lb/>drip: twice as many adults as children reported postnasal drip as <lb/>one of the most bothersome of their nasal allergy symptoms. <lb/>Indeed, bothersome symptoms of nasal allergies in children and <lb/>adults contribute to the heavy burden of nasal allergies such that <lb/>AR is ranked as one of the top 10 reasons for primary care <lb/>physician visits in the United States. 23,24 <lb/>BURDEN OF PEDIATRIC AR <lb/>Traditionally, AR has been regarded as more of a nuisance <lb/>than a substantive disease.

			<body>(32%) of parents believed that their children with allergies were <lb/>&apos;&apos;full of life&apos;&apos; all of the time versus approximately half of parents <lb/>of children without allergies (P &lt; .001). Similar disparities ex-<lb/>isted for other questions relating to their children&apos;s emotional <lb/>health. Parents of children with nasal allergy and allergy-free chil-<lb/>dren, respectively, answered whether their children had lots of en-<lb/>ergy (37% vs 50%, P &lt; .001), whether they were calm and <lb/>peaceful all of the time (18% vs 29%, P &lt; .01), or whether they <lb/>had generally been happy all of the time (28% vs 32%, P &lt; .05) <lb/>in the previous 4 weeks (Fig 6, B).

			<body>effect of nasal allergies on children&apos;s social lives and productivity can <lb/>be assessed in 3 ways: effect on absenteeism, effect on productivity <lb/>(presenteeism), and effect on daily activities (avoidance). <lb/>Nasal allergies, health, or both interfered with the daily school <lb/>activities of US children such that approximately two thirds of <lb/>children (with or without AR) had missed school or day care in the <lb/>past 12 months because of allergies, health reasons, or both <lb/>(absenteeism). Although the rate of absenteeism is roughly equal <lb/>among children with and without AR, presenteeism (or dimin-<lb/>ished performance while at school) appears to be a significant <lb/>burden of AR that is frequently overlooked: a large percentage of <lb/>parents (40%) report that their children&apos;s condition interferes with <lb/>their performance at school (P &lt; .001). The true effect of presen-<lb/>teeism has not generally been considered in previous studies on <lb/>the burden of AR in children. In addition to the survey&apos;s findings <lb/>on absenteeism and presenteeism, 28% of parents reported that <lb/>their children with nasal allergies avoided daily activities because <lb/>of their symptoms (P &lt; 0.001; Fig 6, C). Furthermore, when the <lb/>Pediatric Allergies in America survey asked parents to quantify <lb/>the effect of their children&apos;s nasal allergies, health, or both, par-<lb/>ents of children with allergies reported a 30% decrease in their <lb/>children&apos;s productivity at school and at home when allergy symp-<lb/>toms were at their worst (Fig 6, D). <lb/>Children with nasal allergies are also more limited in their daily <lb/>activities than children without allergies. Almost twice as many <lb/>(21%) parents of children with nasal allergy reported that their <lb/>children&apos;s condition or health limited the kind of work or other <lb/>activities they could do compared with parents of allergy-free <lb/>children (11%, P &lt; .001). In addition, when compared with the <lb/>parents of allergy-free children, more than twice as many parents <lb/>reported that their children with nasal allergies found performing <lb/>work or other activities difficult (23% vs 10%, P &lt; .001). It is sug-<lb/>gestive that the difficulty in completing assigned tasks that was <lb/>observed by parents might explain the overall reduction (22%) <lb/>in the amount of time spent by the child with nasal allergies on <lb/>daily activities compared with the allergy-free child (10%, P &lt; <lb/>.001). Parents&apos; reports of decreased productivity, difficulty in <lb/>completing tasks, and reduced amount of time spent on daily ac-<lb/>tivities resulted in reductions in what the child with nasal allergies <lb/>was perceived to accomplish on a daily basis. Parents of children <lb/>with nasal allergies were more than twice as likely to report de-<lb/>creased productivity in their children as a result of their condition <lb/>or health compared with parents of children without allergies <lb/>(23% vs 10%, respectively; P &lt; .001; Fig 6, E). <lb/>Activity avoidance can be an insidious effect of nasal allergies on <lb/>children&apos;s social lives. For instance, among children of school age, <lb/>17% experienced a lot or some interference with school activities <lb/>related to AR compared with 5% of children without allergies <lb/>(P &lt; 0.001; Fig 7, A). Similarly, when parents were asked whether <lb/>allergy symptoms or health interfered with their children&apos;s daily <lb/>activities, parents of children with AR were approximately 3 times <lb/>more likely to report that allergies affect whether their child <lb/>performs well in school (26% vs 9%, P &lt; .001). General outdoor <lb/>activities, going outside or playing with friends, and organized <lb/>sports or exercise participation were limited approximately 3 to 4 <lb/>times more frequently in children with nasal allergy than in allergy-<lb/>free children (P &lt; .001 for all). These reductions may contribute to <lb/>the high prevalence of US children who are overweight (16%) or at <lb/>risk for being overweight (32%), which is defined as the 95th <lb/>percentile or greater or the 85th percentile or greater of the Centers <lb/>for Disease Control and Prevention sex-adjusted body mass <lb/>index-for-age growth charts, respectively. 25 The smallest <lb/>FIG 6.

			<body>difference in parental opinion between these 2 groups of children <lb/>was whether indoor activities were limited: 12% of parents of chil-<lb/>dren with nasal allergy said that their children&apos;s allergies or health <lb/>interfered a lot or some with indoor activities compared with only <lb/>5% of parents of children without nasal allergies (P &lt; .001). <lb/>Sleep problems <lb/>In addition to the general effects of nasal allergy symptoms on <lb/>daily activities, the symptoms of AR have a profound effect on the <lb/>ability to sleep for both adults and children with the disease. Several <lb/>studies have demonstrated that nasal obstruction or congestion, <lb/>such as occurs with AR, is associated with a disruption in the normal <lb/>pattern of breathing in adults. 26,27 In fact, more than half (57%) of <lb/>adult patients and 88% of pediatric patients with AR are estimated <lb/>to experience difficulty sleeping. 28-30 One such study in adults, the <lb/>Burden of Allergic Rhinitis, found that adults with AR have a <lb/>reduced quality of sleep as measured by the sleep-problems index <lb/>or the sleep-adequacy scale. Furthermore, this study found that <lb/>adult patients with AR were approximately 10 times more likely <lb/>to experience brief awakenings, or microarousals, during sleep <lb/>when allergy symptoms were at their worst. 31 These disruptions <lb/>were thought to be a result of increased upper airway resistance <lb/>brought about by symptoms such as nasal congestion and runny <lb/>nose. Sleep disruption contributes to daytime fatigue in many <lb/>patients with AR; however, for reasons not completely understood, <lb/>there appears to be an added effect of AR on daytime drowsiness <lb/>that might be independent of nighttime sleep impairment. 32,33 <lb/>Furthermore, during childhood and adolescence, sleep-disordered <lb/>breathing has been associated with an increased frequency of learn-<lb/>ing performance disorders, behavioral disorders, and attention-<lb/>deficit disorders. 34,35 AR has also been demonstrated to adversely <lb/>affect childhood learning and decrease cognitive functioning. 36 <lb/>The data from the Pediatric Allergies in America survey <lb/>support the assertion that nasal allergy symptoms commonly <lb/>experienced by children disrupt both the pattern and quality of <lb/>sleep. In fact, 40% of parents of children with nasal allergy report <lb/>that their children&apos;s allergies/health interfere a lot or some with <lb/>sleep compared with only 7% of parents of children without <lb/>allergies (P &lt; .001). Parents of children with nasal allergy were <lb/>more than twice as likely to describe sleep problems, such as dif-<lb/>ficulty in falling asleep (32% vs 12%, P &lt; .001), waking during <lb/>the night (26% vs 8%, P &lt; .001), and lack of a good night&apos;s sleep <lb/>(29% vs 12%, P &lt; .001), in their children compared with parents <lb/>of children without allergies (Fig 7, B). These findings support the <lb/>assertion that AR exerts a profound effect on the physical, mental <lb/>and emotional, and social health of children in the United States. <lb/>Comorbid conditions <lb/>Comorbid conditions occurring with AR include eye symp-<lb/>toms, such as conjunctivitis, ear problems (otitis), and head-<lb/>aches. 17,29 For example, allergic conjunctivitis (red itchy eyes) <lb/>was reported by parents to occur in 29% of children with AR ev-<lb/>ery day or most days during their worst month for nasal allergy <lb/>symptoms.

			<body>AR include sinusitis, snoring, and dental issues, such as malocclu-<lb/>sion. 9,17,37,38 Previous studies have estimated the prevalence of <lb/>otitis media in children with nasal allergies to be 21%, whereas <lb/>35% to 50% of children with otitis with effusion were found to <lb/>have nasal allergies. 39,40 Parents&apos; responses in the Pediatric Aller-<lb/>gies in America survey support these data. Parents reported that <lb/>children diagnosed with AR were approximately 5 times more <lb/>likely to experience pressure-related ear pain at least a few days <lb/>during their worst month for allergy symptoms than children <lb/>without AR (P &lt; .001). Among children with AR, more than <lb/>half (56%) reported their ear pain as moderately or extremely <lb/>bothersome. Interestingly, the peak season for both ragweed-<lb/>and mold-induced allergies coincides with the peak season for <lb/>Eustachian tube problems in children with nasal allergies. 41 In <lb/>fact, 16% of children with AR have had tubes placed in their <lb/>ears compared with 9% of children without allergies (P &lt; .05). <lb/>Additionally, 18% of children with AR had their tonsils, adenoids, <lb/>or both removed compared with 11% of children without allergies <lb/>(P &lt; .01). These findings demonstrate a nearly 2-fold increased <lb/>incidence of surgery to treat ear and upper airway infections in <lb/>children with AR versus children without AR, a finding that might <lb/>suggest either an increased susceptibility to upper airway diseases <lb/>in children with symptomatic AR or the frustration of patients, <lb/>parents, and clinicians with the results of previous interventions <lb/>(Table II). <lb/>Several studies have clearly demonstrated that a strong corre-<lb/>lation exists between allergy and sinus problems in the general <lb/>population, which are estimated to range from 25% to 80%. 17,38 <lb/>The Allergies in America surveys found that 50% of adults and <lb/>43% of children diagnosed with AR had sinus problems, support-<lb/>ing the notion that nasal allergies might be a common factor con-<lb/>tributing to acute or chronic sinus problems. 8 Furthermore, <lb/>parents reported that sinus problems occur more frequently in <lb/>their children diagnosed with AR (43%) compared with children <lb/>without AR (4%), a 10-fold increase (P &lt; .001, Table II). Snoring <lb/>is also a common association with nighttime symptoms of AR. <lb/>Nasal congestion and obstruction as a result of AR might contrib-<lb/>ute to mouth breathing, with a resultant increase in snoring, which <lb/>can then be considered an additional nighttime symptom of the <lb/>disease. 9 In a study of adults who regularly (&gt;15 nights per <lb/>month) experienced nighttime nasal allergy symptoms, 47% <lb/>were found to be chronic snorers. In comparison, the Pediatric <lb/>Allergies in America survey found that more than twice as <lb/>many children with nasal allergies snore every night (14%) or <lb/>most nights (10%) compared with children without nasal allergies <lb/>(5% and 4%, respectively; P &lt; .001; Table II). <lb/>In addition, frequent nighttime AR symptoms were also <lb/>strongly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and <lb/>chronic nonrestorative sleep in adults. 27 This is likely to be true <lb/>in children as well, with 40% of parents noting that their chil-<lb/>dren&apos;s allergies interfered with sleep. Chronic mouth breathing <lb/>in children, a common result of the frequent nasal congestion ob-<lb/>served in patients with AR, has also been associated with ortho-<lb/>dontic malocclusions. Children with nasal congestion are likely <lb/>to breathe through their mouths, and mouth breathing has been <lb/>linked to an almost 3-fold increase in incidence of orthodontic <lb/>malocclusions compared with nose breathing. 37 <lb/>Parents report that significantly more children with AR com-<lb/>pared with children without AR had headaches (54% vs 19%, P &lt; <lb/>.001) and facial pain or pressure (28% vs 4%, P &lt; .001), respec-<lb/>tively, at least a few days during their worst month in the previous <lb/>year. Headache (59% vs 68%) and facial pain (53% vs 54%) were <lb/>considered moderately or extremely bothersome by more than <lb/>half of the parents of children with AR and older children with <lb/>AR (10-17 years of age) surveyed, respectively. These figures rep-<lb/>resent a nearly 3-fold increase in headaches and a 7-fold increase <lb/>in facial pain or pressure in children with nasal allergies compared <lb/>with children without allergies. These findings suggest that chil-<lb/>dren with inadequately controlled symptomatic AR might experi-<lb/>ence an underappreciated degree of head and facial discomfort <lb/>that is not shared in children free of nasal allergies (Table II). <lb/>In patients with AR, concomitant lower airway involvement is <lb/>common. There appears to be both neurologic and inflammatory <lb/>crosstalk between these conditions. 42 Furthermore, AR is not only <lb/>a risk factor for asthma, but asthma might also be exacerbated as a <lb/>result of uncontrolled AR. There is increasing evidence support-<lb/>ing the concept that AR and asthma are similar chronic inflamma-<lb/>tory diseases affecting the upper and lower airways, <lb/>respectively. 43 Recent surveys suggest a solid link between <lb/>them: approximately 78% of patients with asthma have AR, and <lb/>38% of patients with AR have concomitant asthma. 44,45 In <lb/>many ways, AR and asthma have significant effects on patient <lb/>QoL. <lb/>The Pediatric Allergies in America survey found that among <lb/>children diagnosed with AR, 39% also were diagnosed with <lb/>asthma, and 28% of children diagnosed with AR also had asthma <lb/>symptoms in the past 12 months. These figures represent a <lb/>significant 3-to 4-fold higher incidence of asthma in children with <lb/>AR than in children with no AR (P &lt; .001 for each comparison). <lb/>Interestingly, when compared with data uncovered in the Aller-<lb/>gies in America survey of adults with AR, the prevalence of <lb/>TABLE II.

			<body>comorbid asthma in children observed in the Pediatric Allergies <lb/>in America survey differed by sex. Forty-five percent of male chil-<lb/>dren and 33% of female children with AR had concomitant <lb/>asthma, whereas 29% of adult male and 34% of adult female pa-<lb/>tients had concomitant asthma. These surveys show that although <lb/>asthma is common in both pediatric and adult patients with symp-<lb/>tomatic AR, the diagnosis of asthma appears to be more common <lb/>in pediatric male patients than in adult male patients. Numerous <lb/>studies have shown that among children with AR, the ratio of <lb/>concomitant asthma in boys to girls is roughly 2:1. 46-51 Although <lb/>the Pediatric Allergies in America study describes a similar find-<lb/>ing that male children might be more prone to concomitant <lb/>asthma than female children, the finding is closer to a 1.4-fold <lb/>higher frequency in male than in female children. This discrep-<lb/>ancy between sexes appears to even out by adulthood, a finding <lb/>that is supported by the Allergies in America surveys. 7,9 Overall, <lb/>pediatric patients with AR have a 3-to 4-fold increased incidence <lb/>of asthma versus children without AR. Treatment of AR symp-<lb/>toms in adults has been demonstrated in several studies to reduce <lb/>the incidence and severity of asthma. 52-56 These findings suggest <lb/>that the putative link between AR and asthma warrants further ex-<lb/>amination and that an expanded understanding of AR treatment <lb/>effect on the incidence and symptoms of asthma in children is <lb/>also warranted (Table III). <lb/>The Pediatric Allergies in America survey has generated <lb/>compelling evidence that children with nasal allergies might <lb/>experience substantially more physical, mental, emotional, <lb/>and social problems than children who do not have allergies. <lb/>The increased burden of symptoms frequently undermines <lb/>restful sleep, leaving children fatigued throughout the day. <lb/>Daytime drowsiness as a result of AR can result in impair-<lb/>ments in learning and cognition through absenteeism, pre-<lb/>senteeism, and activity avoidance. In addition, the chronic <lb/>inflammation associated with AR frequently causes comorbid <lb/>conditions, such as allergic conjunctivitis; generalized facial, <lb/>head, and ear pain, sometimes leading to surgery (eg, ade-<lb/>noidectomy, tonsillectomy, and placement of tympanostomy <lb/>tubes); and other significant airway diseases, such as sinusitis <lb/>and asthma. These findings are in concordance with those <lb/>obtained in the Allergies in America survey of adults with <lb/>nasal allergies. <lb/>NEED FOR TREATMENT OF AR SYMPTOMS <lb/>Through the combination of bothersome symptoms, compro-<lb/>mised sleep, and effect on physical, mental, and emotional health, <lb/>AR has a profound effect on the daily lives of children with the <lb/>disease. When asked to estimate the effect of nasal allergy <lb/>symptoms on their children, 1 in 4 parents felt that nasal allergies <lb/>affected their child&apos;s life a lot (9%) or a moderate amount (17%) <lb/>during the allergy season. Interestingly, compared with parents, <lb/>HCPs reported that AR has a far greater effect on their patients&apos; <lb/>lives: more than 3 in 4 HCPs estimated that nasal allergies affect <lb/>the lives of their pediatric patients a lot (26%) or a moderate <lb/>amount (51%; Fig 8, A). <lb/>Many children cannot tolerate the discomfort associated with <lb/>nasal allergy attacks without symptom relief. Parents reported that <lb/>the amount of discomfort their children with nasal allergies <lb/>experienced during nasal allergy attacks was significant. The <lb/>majority (57%) of parents said that although their child&apos;s discom-<lb/>fort during an allergy attack could not be ignored, it was tolerable. <lb/>Only 8% of parents believed that their children could ignore the <lb/>discomfort caused by a nasal allergy attack. Similarly, more than <lb/>60% of HCPs agreed that although their pediatric patients cannot <lb/>ignore nasal allergy symptoms, they could tolerate them. One <lb/>would expect that a child&apos;s ability to ignore nasal allergy <lb/>symptoms plays a large role in their effect on that child&apos;s daily <lb/>life. Both parents (33%) and HCPs (35%) agreed that the <lb/>discomfort some children experienced during a nasal allergy <lb/>attack was not tolerable without relief (Fig 8, B). <lb/>In general, children with nasal allergies are more likely to be <lb/>seen by a physician or allied HCP than children without nasal <lb/>allergies. Most (83%) parents of children with nasal allergies <lb/>reported 2 or more visits to their child&apos;s HCPs in the preceding 12 <lb/>months for general health concerns compared with 61% of parents <lb/>of children without nasal allergies. HCP visits for nasal allergy <lb/>symptoms were also frequent, with 62% of parents reporting that <lb/>their children had seen an HCP about their nasal allergies in the <lb/>preceding 12 months. Remarkably, 17% of parents of children <lb/>with nasal allergies reported that their children had seen an HCP 5 <lb/>or more times in the past 12 months primarily for their nasal <lb/>allergy symptoms. Although practitioner visits were frequent, in-<lb/>office immunotherapy for nasal allergies was uncommon: only 8% <lb/>of patients received allergy injection treatments by their HCP <lb/>during those office visits within the past year. <lb/>Most children with nasal allergies take medication to control <lb/>their symptoms. Three fourths (76%) of parents of children with <lb/>nasal allergies said that their children took either an OTC or <lb/>prescription medicine for their nasal allergies in the past 4 weeks. <lb/>It is apparently not uncommon for OTC and prescription med-<lb/>ications to be used in combination for treatment of the bothersome <lb/>symptoms of nasal allergies. In fact, a recent survey reported that <lb/>many adults with AR use 2 to 4 medications simultaneously to <lb/>control their AR symptoms. 57 When parents were asked what <lb/>types of medication their children used for allergy symptom relief <lb/>during the past 4 weeks, more than half (54%) reported the use of <lb/>an OTC medicine, whereas slightly fewer (48%) reported use of <lb/>prescription medications. One fourth (26%) of parents said that <lb/>their children had used a prescription nasal spray, and one third <lb/>(34%) of parents reported that their children had taken some other <lb/>prescription medications (excluding nasal sprays) to control their <lb/>allergy symptoms in the past 4 weeks. Only 24% of parents re-<lb/>ported that their children used no medication in the past 4 weeks. <lb/>Historically, parents report that 34% of their children use pre-<lb/>scription allergy medications only, 25% use OTC medications <lb/>only, and 39% use a combination of both prescription and OTC <lb/>medications for nasal allergy relief. Only 2% report that they do <lb/>not use any medication for AR (Fig 8, C). <lb/>Parents and physicians recognize that nasal allergies have a <lb/>moderate-to-severe effect on the lives of children. Although the <lb/>discomfort associated with nasal allergies is generally considered <lb/>by parents and practitioners to be tolerable for children, most <lb/>parents and practitioners acknowledge that without symptom relief <lb/>from medication, these symptoms cannot be ignored. Children with <lb/>nasal allergies are more prone than children without nasal allergies <lb/>to require visits to their HCP for relief of symptoms or for general <lb/>health concerns. As a result of the discomfort and health effects <lb/>caused by nasal allergies, most children take prescription or OTC <lb/>medication to relieve bothersome symptoms of their nasal allergies. <lb/>These findings on the need for treatment of nasal allergies in <lb/>children are similar to data obtained in the Allergies in America <lb/>survey of adults with nasal allergies. Forty percent of adults believed <lb/></body>

			<body>that their nasal allergy symptoms had a moderate-to-large effect on <lb/>their daily lives compared with 26% of children. 8 As a result, 69% of <lb/>adults with nasal allergies reported that they were currently taking <lb/>either a prescription or OTC medication to control their symptoms. <lb/>Remarkably, when adult patients and practitioners were asked <lb/>whether the discomfort caused by their nasal allergy symptoms <lb/>could be tolerated or ignored, nearly half of adult patients (44%) <lb/>and HCPs (49%) said that the discomfort could not be tolerated <lb/>without relief, whereas 51% of adult patients and HCPs alike said <lb/>that the discomfort could be tolerated but not ignored. These find-<lb/>ings are in contrast to the Pediatric Allergies in America survey, <lb/>which reported much lower parent and practitioner estimates of <lb/>whether children&apos;s nasal allergy symptoms were tolerable without <lb/>relief. This discrepancy might suggest a reduced emphasis on how <lb/>complaints of nasal allergy symptoms in children are regarded by <lb/>parents and HCPs compared with nasal allergy symptoms in adults. <lb/>Taken together, the data on the need for treatment obtained from the <lb/>2 Allergies in America surveys strengthen the assertion that nasal al-<lb/>lergies have a profound effect on the lives of both adults and children <lb/>with AR. Furthermore, it appears that medication is often required to <lb/>alleviate these symptoms of nasal allergies and to reduce the burden <lb/>of this disease on the daily lives of Americans with AR. <lb/>EFFICACY OF CURRENT NASAL ALLERGY <lb/>MEDICATIONS IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH AR <lb/>Ideally, children experiencing uncontrolled rhinitis symptoms <lb/>should be referred by their pediatrician to an allergy specialist for <lb/>consultation and specific allergen testing. Once the determination <lb/>that a specific allergen is responsible for the nasal symptoms, ocular <lb/>symptoms, or both has been made, appropriate steps to remove the <lb/>allergen or otherwise limit exposure to the allergen should be made. <lb/>The benefit would be that identifying the causative allergen or <lb/>allergens could dramatically improve the likelihood of encouraging <lb/>reduction of the allergen burden in the home and of education to <lb/>reduce allergen exposure outdoors. Methods to effectively decrease <lb/>the indoor allergen threshold (albeit with mixed results) have been <lb/>extensively described elsewhere. 58,59 Environmental controls, such <lb/>as allergen avoidance, removal of indoor allergy triggers, or both, <lb/>can be an important first step to the general management of AR <lb/>and asthma, although, with the exceptions of avoidance of pet dan-<lb/>der and tobacco, they are not usually of major benefit. 17,18,20,60 <lb/>Avoidance can reduce overall allergen exposure and the severity <lb/>of AR symptoms. Allergen avoidance can also be effective, to <lb/>some degree, in controlling exposure to dust mites, mold, and fungi <lb/>in the home (through humidity control, high-efficiency particulate <lb/>air filtration, and cleaning with a dilute bleach solution for mold <lb/>and fungi). 18 Limiting exposure to outdoor triggers on high-pol-<lb/>len-count days can be difficult for individuals who are sensitive to <lb/>pollen, 17 although reporting of pollen counts as part of a daily <lb/>news broadcast during the peak pollen season is becoming increas-<lb/>ingly common in many areas and might help sensitive individuals <lb/>minimize their exposure. Although environmental control of <lb/>allergen exposure is a necessary step in preventing AR symptoms, <lb/>pharmacologic therapy is often required for control of moderate-<lb/>to-severe symptoms of nasal allergies. 60 <lb/>Numerous options exist for both OTC and prescription pharma-<lb/>cologic management of AR, including oral and intranasal antihis-<lb/>tamines, decongestants, leukotriene inhibitors, immunotherapy, and <lb/>INCSs. Despite reasonably effective control of nasal allergy <lb/>symptoms, these medications can have local side effects, such as <lb/>epistaxis, nasal dryness, irritation, and burning from the intranasal <lb/>medications, and systemic side effects, such as drowsiness from <lb/>antihistamines. 11,12 Immunotherapy, an established adjunct to AR <lb/>pharmacologic management, decreases nasal tissue reactivity <lb/>through increased allergen tolerance or IgE attenuation by <lb/>mAbs. 19,61 Although shown to be safe and effective for the treat-<lb/>ment of AR, immunotherapy is not generally considered a first-<lb/>line treatment and might suffer from poor patient adherence because <lb/>of the prolonged treatment needed to obtain durable efficacy. 20 <lb/>INCSs are currently the pharmacologic standard of care for <lb/>treatment of moderate-to-severe persistent AR. INCSs provide <lb/>effective symptom relief by controlling the underlying allergic <lb/>inflammation that results in the disease. Although INCSs are the <lb/>gold standard for pharmacotherapy of AR, the extent that unwanted <lb/>systemic effects, including bone mineral loss, growth retardation, <lb/>adrenal suppression, and ocular disturbances, occur in children <lb/>with long-term use is an appropriate concern. 14,62 Of particular <lb/>note are reports of cortisol suppression and growth slowing during <lb/>treatment with some INCSs. 13-15 Cortisol suppression might be <lb/>problematic in children because of the absence of weight-based <lb/>dosing of INCSs to effectively relieve symptoms. 13,15,16 <lb/>Currently available INCSs and other prescription nasal sprays <lb/>appear to also vary in speed of relief and duration of action and <lb/>might not provide complete or long-lasting relief of nasal allergy <lb/>symptoms. 63 Failure of nasal allergy medications to effectively <lb/>control all symptoms of nasal allergies in all patients might reduce <lb/>satisfaction with treatment and decrease adherence to treatment. <lb/>Sixty-three percent of children with nasal allergies who were <lb/>participants in the Pediatric Allergies in America survey have <lb/>used a prescription nasal spray (INCSs or antihistamines) to treat <lb/>their AR, and 53% have used one in the past year. To better assess <lb/>treatment satisfaction of current prescription nasal sprays in <lb/>children with AR, parents were asked how their children&apos;s current <lb/>medications performed in terms of completeness, speed, and <lb/>duration of relief. Parents and patients alike were unhappy with <lb/>the incomplete relief of AR symptoms obtained with their current <lb/>medications. Most parents considered treatment to be ineffective <lb/>if it did not provide rapid, long-lasting relief of all or most of their <lb/>children&apos;s symptoms. Parents of children who had used a <lb/>prescription nasal spray in the past 4 weeks were asked whether <lb/>their children&apos;s current prescription relieved all, most, some, or <lb/>none of their symptoms. Only 17% reported relief of all of their <lb/>children&apos;s symptoms, but in addition, nearly half (47%) said that <lb/>most of their children&apos;s symptoms were relieved by their current <lb/>prescription. However, almost one third (29%) said that their <lb/>children&apos;s current prescription nasal spray relieved only some <lb/>symptoms, and 4% said that it did not relieve any of their <lb/>children&apos;s symptoms (Fig 9, A). <lb/>In addition to completeness of relief, factors such as speed and <lb/>duration of relief obtained with nasal allergy medications play a <lb/>large role in parent and patient satisfaction with medications. <lb/>Generally, and surprisingly, INCSs are rated by both parents and <lb/>children as having a very rapid onset of action. Indeed, half of <lb/>parents reported that their children&apos;s current INCSs provided <lb/>symptom relief in less than 1 hour (19%) or in 1 hour (31%). <lb/>Notably, 23% of parents reported a 24-hour or longer delay in <lb/>symptom relief with their children&apos;s current prescription. These <lb/>findings suggest that current treatments for AR suffer from a great <lb/>deal of variability in time to onset of symptom relief (Fig 9, B). <lb/>Few parents believe that their children&apos;s current medication <lb/>provides long-lasting relief of symptoms. Parents feel that <lb/></body>

			<body>24-hour relief is a prerequisite for effective treatment. Among <lb/>parents of children who used a prescription nasal spray in the <lb/>previous 4 weeks, more than half (51%) reported that their <lb/>children&apos;s current nasal spray lost effectiveness over the course of <lb/>the day or night. Furthermore, only 36% of parents said that the <lb/>medication relieved symptoms as effectively after 24 hours as <lb/>when their children first took it. The perception among parents <lb/>and patients that medication does not last 24 hours plays a large <lb/>role in parent and patient dissatisfaction with treatment (Fig 9, C). <lb/>Loss of effectiveness over time might be another character-<lb/>istic of nasal allergy medications because 29% of parents of <lb/>children with AR reported that their children&apos;s medication had <lb/>lost effectiveness, even when it was taken as prescribed. <lb/>Thirteen percent of parents said that their children had expe-<lb/>rienced a loss of effectiveness over time with more than 1 nasal <lb/>allergy medication, and another 15% said that their children <lb/>had experienced a loss of effectiveness with only 1 medication <lb/>(Fig 9, D). <lb/>Parents of children with AR were also asked about their <lb/>children&apos;s experience with common unfavorable attributes of <lb/>prescription nasal sprays for allergies. Parents were asked how <lb/>many of the prescription nasal sprays (all, most, some, few, or <lb/>none) their children had taken for allergy symptoms had un-<lb/>wanted attributes. According to nearly half of parents, nasal spray <lb/>dripping down their children&apos;s throats was the most commonly <lb/>occurring side effect of nasal allergy medications. This side effect <lb/>was said to occur with all (21%), most (8%), or some (13%) of <lb/>their children&apos;s nasal allergy medication. The next most fre-<lb/>quently reported common attribute of current nasal allergy <lb/>medication was bad taste. Nearly 2 of 5 parents reported that <lb/>all, most, or some of the nasal allergy medications taken by their <lb/>children had a bad taste. Fewer parents reported that their children <lb/>experienced a drying feeling, burning, drowsiness, and headaches <lb/>as unwanted attributes of their nasal allergy medication (Fig 10, A). <lb/>In addition to being reported as occurring most frequently, <lb/>dripping down the throat and bad taste were reported by parents as <lb/>FIG 9.

			<body>being the most bothersome attributes of their children&apos;s prescription <lb/>nasal spray. Nearly 3 of 10 parents of children with AR reported that <lb/>nasal allergy medication dripping down the throat was moderately <lb/>(19%) or extremely (10%) bothersome to their children. Slightly <lb/>fewer reported that the bad taste of nasal allergy medication was <lb/>moderately or extremely bothersome. A burning sensation, drying <lb/>feeling, headaches, and drowsiness with medication use were <lb/>considered less bothersome by parents (Fig 10, B). <lb/>Notably, 59% of parents report that they have changed their <lb/>children&apos;s nasal allergy medication at least once in the past few <lb/>years. Parents reported changing medication more than once per <lb/>year (8%), once per year (8%), or every few years (10%). Among <lb/>parents whose children had changed nasal allergy medications, <lb/>the most frequently cited reasons for changing medication were <lb/>that the nasal allergy medicine was not effective enough (40%) or <lb/>that their doctor had wanted to try a new medication (22%). <lb/>Children wanting to try another medication or the feeling that the <lb/>medication did not treat their children&apos;s allergy symptoms were <lb/>reported by only 7% of parents as reason for discontinuation. <lb/>Bothersome side effects, insufficient insurance coverage, and <lb/>short-acting relief of symptoms were mentioned much less <lb/>frequently as reasons for changing their children&apos;s nasal allergy <lb/>medication (Fig 11, A). <lb/>Parents and children were occasionally dissatisfied with their <lb/>nasal allergy medication. Among parents and children who had <lb/>asked their doctors for a change of medication, ineffectiveness <lb/>(63%) and bothersome side effects (18%) were the most frequent <lb/>reasons for dissatisfaction with a child&apos;s nasal allergy medication. <lb/>Similarly, effectiveness wearing off over time (10%) and incom-<lb/>plete 24-hour symptom relief (9%) were reasons that the parent or <lb/>child had been dissatisfied with nasal allergy medications. <lb/>Difficulty in administration or problems with the dosing schedule, <lb/>incomplete insurance coverage or high copay, or product safety <lb/>concerns were mentioned less frequently by parents as reasons for <lb/>dissatisfaction with medication (Fig 11, B). <lb/>Dissatisfaction with nasal allergy medications can occasionally <lb/>lead to poor adherence, as well as discontinuation of medication. <lb/>Simply put, children often do not take their nasal allergy <lb/>medication as prescribed. In addition to times when symptoms <lb/>have abated, children also stop taking their medication as <lb/>prescribed when it does not relieve their symptoms (26%) or <lb/>when it loses effectiveness over time (24%). Troublesome side <lb/>effects (20%) and worry about side effects (19%) were also <lb/>reported by parents as reasons that their children stopped taking <lb/>their allergy medication as prescribed. Nearly as many parents <lb/>(17%) reported poor tolerance and a concern about long-term use <lb/>as reasons. To a lesser extent, safety concerns and medication cost <lb/>were reported as reasons why their children had failed to follow <lb/>their physician&apos;s instructions regarding their nasal allergy med-<lb/>ications (Fig 11, C). <lb/>FIG 10.

			<body>Although relatively few parents reported being dissatisfied <lb/>with their children&apos;s current OTC or prescription nasal allergy <lb/>medicines, 26% asked their children&apos;s doctors to change their <lb/>medication because of dissatisfaction. The most common reason <lb/>for parents asking their children&apos;s doctors to change prescriptions <lb/>was that the medication was not effective enough at controlling <lb/>their children&apos;s nasal allergy symptoms. Bothersome side effects, <lb/>effectiveness wearing off over weeks to months, and ineffective <lb/>24-hour relief of symptoms also resulted in the parent or child <lb/>asking the doctor to change nasal allergy medication. <lb/>In summary, most parents reported that they or their children <lb/>were unhappy with the incomplete relief of symptoms provided <lb/>by their current nasal allergy medication. These medications are <lb/>not viewed by parents as providing rapid, long-lasting relief of all <lb/>or most of their children&apos;s symptoms. Many parents and patients <lb/>feel that 24-hour relief of symptoms is a prerequisite for an <lb/>effective nasal allergy medication yet their children&apos;s current <lb/>nasal allergy medication does not relieve symptoms for a full 24 <lb/>hours. Parents and patients also believe that the effectiveness of <lb/>current nasal allergy medications can wear off over weeks to <lb/>months. <lb/>For comparison, the Allergies in America survey reported <lb/>similar findings on the efficacy of prescription nasal sprays for <lb/>the treatment of AR. Adults (61%) and parents of children <lb/>(64%) with AR reported that INCSs relieved all or most of their <lb/>nasal allergy symptoms. 8 Relief was also achieved in 1 hour or <lb/>less by most adults (59%) and children (50%), although similar <lb/>numbers of adults (17%) and children (23%) waited at least <lb/>1 day to more than a week for the onset of symptom relief. <lb/>Approximately one half of adults and children reported that their <lb/>current nasal allergy medication did not provide 24-hour relief <lb/>of nasal allergy symptoms. Interestingly, it appears that adults <lb/>might experience loss of effectiveness of their nasal allergy <lb/>medications over time more frequently than children. Adult <lb/>patients (55%) and parents of children with nasal allergies <lb/>(29%) reported a loss of effectiveness over time with 1 or <lb/>more nasal allergy medications. <lb/>Bothersome side effects were reported by both parents of <lb/>children with AR (16%) and adult patients (21%) as reasons for <lb/>dissatisfaction with INCSs and other prescription nasal sprays. <lb/>Although adult and pediatric patients experienced similar both-<lb/>ersome side effects of nasal allergies, a drying feeling, drowsi-<lb/>ness, and headaches occurred more commonly and were <lb/>considered much more bothersome to adults than to children. A <lb/>drying feeling in response to the medication was considered <lb/>moderately or extremely bothersome by 34% of adults and 14% <lb/>of children. Drowsiness experienced with nasal allergy medica-<lb/>tion was reported as moderately or extremely bothersome by 33% <lb/>of adults compared with 11% of children. Finally, 25% of adults <lb/>compared with 13% of children experienced headaches that were <lb/>considered to be moderately to extremely bothersome. Taken <lb/>together, the Allergies in America surveys have identified similar <lb/>FIG 11. Reasons for dissatisfaction with medication and reduced adherence to treatment.

			<body>reasons for patient dissatisfaction with their nasal allergy med-<lb/>ication or disease management that might result in discontinua-<lb/>tion of treatment: incomplete relief, slow time to onset of relief, <lb/>loss of effectiveness over time, and bothersome side effects <lb/>contribute to this dissatisfaction in adult patients, parents of <lb/>children, and children with AR. <lb/>PEDIATRIC PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH <lb/>PRESCRIPTION NASAL SPRAYS FOR AR <lb/>Because AR is a chronic inflammatory condition, regular <lb/>prophylactic use of medication might be required to achieve <lb/>effective long-term control of nasal allergy symptoms. Adherence <lb/>to the prescribed AR regimen is needed to maintain reduction of <lb/>inflammation and resultant nasal allergy symptoms. However, as <lb/>many as 1 in 3 adults might be inconsistent in the regular use of <lb/>their prescribed AR medications, and 40% to 80% of these <lb/>patients might discontinue treatment within 6 weeks. 64 <lb/>Results of the Pediatric Allergies in America survey strongly <lb/>support assertions that patients&apos; concerns over the efficacy, slow <lb/>onset of action, and duration of symptom relief achieved with <lb/>INCSs and other nasal allergy medications contribute to patients&apos; <lb/>dissatisfaction and nonadherence. In addition, the survey indi-<lb/>cates that the bothersome attributes of prescription nasal sprays, <lb/>such as medication dripping down the throat, bad taste, and nasal <lb/>drying, which are reported to occur frequently in most of the <lb/>currently available prescription nasal sprays formulations, also <lb/>contribute to patient dissatisfaction with prescription nasal sprays. <lb/>Parent and HCP perspectives on patient satisfaction <lb/>with current prescription nasal sprays <lb/>Parents of children with AR and HCPs are in reasonable <lb/>agreement in their perceptions of patients&apos; satisfaction with <lb/>disease management and treatment. When HCPs were asked to <lb/>estimate the percentage of their patients who were &apos;&apos;very satis-<lb/>fied&apos;&apos; with the management of their AR, 3 of 4 providers reported <lb/>that, on average, all (3%) or most (70%) of their patients 4 to 17 <lb/>years of age were very satisfied with disease management. Broken <lb/>down by HCP category, allergists, pediatricians, otolaryngolo-<lb/>gists, family practice doctors, and NPs/PAs believed that all or <lb/>most of their patients with AR were very satisfied with the <lb/>management of their disease. Similarly, 68% of parents were very <lb/>satisfied with the management of their children&apos;s AR (Fig 12, A). <lb/>HCP perspectives on patient satisfaction with <lb/>prescription nasal sprays <lb/>In addition to satisfaction with disease management, HCPs <lb/>were asked to estimate how satisfied their pediatric patients were <lb/>with their prescription nasal sprays. Approximately 9 of 10 HCPs <lb/>said that their patients were very or somewhat satisfied with their <lb/>current prescription nasal sprays. In contrast to HCP assessments, <lb/>however, only 3 (76%) of 4 parents said that they were very or <lb/>somewhat satisfied with their children&apos;s prescription nasal sprays <lb/>(Fig 12, B). When asked to weigh in on the cost benefit of pre-<lb/>scription nasal sprays for children, the vast majority (82%) of <lb/>HCPs reported that the medication was worth the money. In con-<lb/>trast, only 63% of parents believed that they get their money&apos;s <lb/>worth out of prescription medicines for their children&apos;s nasal al-<lb/>lergies (Fig 12, C). <lb/>HCPs were asked which types of medication they preferred <lb/>for their patients with AR (with multiple answers permitted). <lb/>Forty-one percent of providers reported that their medication of <lb/>choice was an INCS, 27% preferred prescription antihistamines, <lb/>7% preferred OTC antihistamines, 6% preferred leukotriene <lb/>receptor antagonists, 4% preferred a prescription antihistamine/ <lb/>decongestant combination, and 4% preferred intranasal antihis-<lb/>tamines. The remaining 10% of HCP responses included pref-<lb/>erences for anticholinergic nasal sprays, OTC decongestants, and <lb/>mast cell stabilizers. Among family practice and internal med-<lb/>icine HCPs, INCSs and prescription antihistamines were equally <lb/>preferred (34% each). In contrast, providers who specialized in <lb/>allergy, immunology, or otolaryngology preferred INCSs to <lb/>prescription antihistamines by a considerable margin (47% vs <lb/>26%, respectively). Similarly, pediatricians also preferred INCSs <lb/>to prescription antihistamines by nearly 2 to 1 (40% vs 23%, <lb/>respectively). <lb/>Comparison of perspectives on AR <lb/>Both parents of children with nasal allergies and parents of <lb/>allergy-free children provided similar responses when asked <lb/>about their attitudes concerning AR, its treatment, and its effect <lb/>on their children&apos;s lifestyle. When asked whether nasal allergies <lb/>usually cause some lifestyle limitations, nearly 7 of 10 parents <lb/>from both groups believed they did. Both groups of parents also <lb/>agreed that frequent nasal allergy symptoms can be prevented. <lb/>When asked about the effect of AR on comorbid conditions, <lb/>approximately three fourths of parents were aware that nasal <lb/>allergies can make asthma worse and that nasal allergies can <lb/>cause sinus infections. Although parents of children with allergy <lb/>and allergy-free children alike agreed that nasal allergies can <lb/>negatively affect children&apos;s lives, only 75% of parents of children <lb/>without allergies believed that nasal allergies are a serious health <lb/>problem in the United States compared with nearly 9 of 10 parents <lb/>of children with allergies (P &lt; .001). In addition, 35% of parents <lb/>of children with nasal allergies and 25% of parents of allergy-free <lb/>children believed that there are no truly effective treatments for <lb/>nasal allergies (P &lt; .001). Finally, parents with a child with aller-<lb/>gies were significantly less likely to agree with the statement that <lb/>prescription nasal sprays are not safe for children (P &lt; .05), a be-<lb/>lief that appears to be more widely held by parents of allergy-free <lb/>children (Fig 12, D). This finding suggests that efforts have been <lb/>made to make parents of children with allergies aware of the side <lb/>effect profile of prescription nasal sprays. <lb/>Patient and provider education <lb/>Parents and HCPs agree that better education about nasal <lb/>allergies is needed for both parents of children with nasal allergy <lb/>and the children themselves. Nearly all parents and providers <lb/>answered that there was at least a moderate to a strong need for <lb/>improved education for parents of children with AR (Fig 12, E). <lb/>Improved educational resources should provide an understanding <lb/>of the burden of AR, its symptoms and available treatment op-<lb/>tions, and reasons for poor adherence and reduced efficacy of pre-<lb/>scription nasal sprays. Improved access to education should not <lb/>be directed solely toward the patient and family, however. Despite <lb/>an understanding of the AR burden, many HCPs appear to over-<lb/>estimate patient satisfaction with their prescription medications. <lb/>This affects not only patient satisfaction with treatment but also <lb/></body>

			<body>satisfaction with HCPs. Dissatisfaction with prescription nasal <lb/>sprays in children appears to stem predominantly from failure <lb/>of the medication to provide rapid, complete, sustained relief of <lb/>nasal allergy symptoms, as well as from bothersome side effects <lb/>of the medication&apos;s formulation. Greater HCP awareness of this <lb/>issue might encourage education about the typical onset of action <lb/>of prescription medications and the need for adherence to dose <lb/>and schedule to maintain effectiveness, as well as the proper <lb/>use of the delivery device to reduce side effects. <lb/>Patient dissatisfaction decreases adherence to medication and <lb/>results in lower-than-anticipated efficacy. In patients with asthma, <lb/>nonadherence to the prescribed regimen has been suggested to <lb/>occur for many reasons, including inconvenient dosing frequency, <lb/>difficulty of use, and the side effect profile of the medication. 65 Be-<lb/>cause asthma and AR are both chronic diseases with a similar <lb/>cause, improving the formulation characteristics of prescription na-<lb/>sal sprays (ie, dosing, ease of use, and sensory attributes) might in-<lb/>crease patient adherence to AR therapy and enhance patient <lb/>response to treatment. This survey has identified a number of for-<lb/>mulation considerations for prescription nasal sprays for use in chil-<lb/>dren. The development of prescription nasal sprays with favorable <lb/>formulation characteristics might improve efficacy and tolerability <lb/>and reduce side effects common with prescription nasal spray treat-<lb/>ment. Improving the sensory attributes of these medications might <lb/>also improve patient satisfaction and adherence to therapy. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The Pediatric Allergies in America survey has highlighted gaps <lb/>in our understanding of AR and the profound effect AR has on <lb/>children. During the times when allergy symptoms are at their <lb/>worst, children experience nasal congestion, headache, postnasal <lb/>drip, repeated sneezing, runny nose, and other symptoms on a <lb/>near-daily basis. These symptoms were described as being <lb/>moderately to extremely bothersome by most parents of children <lb/>with nasal allergies. Because of the effect of these allergy <lb/>symptoms on sleep quality, most children with AR tend to feel <lb/>tired, miserable, and irritable at least sometimes during peak <lb/>allergy exacerbations. <lb/>In addition to examining the prevalence, symptoms, and <lb/>burden of AR in the US pediatric population, the survey <lb/>addressed the role of nasal allergy medications in the treatment <lb/>of AR, including patient and provider perspectives on both the <lb/>effectiveness and bothersome side effects of INCSs and other <lb/>prescription nasal sprays. Parents and physicians generally agree <lb/>that about one third of patients do not achieve relief of all or <lb/>most of their nasal allergy symptoms from prescription nasal <lb/>sprays. In addition to low perceptions of effectiveness, onset of <lb/>relief was reported to be delayed for 24 hours or longer by more <lb/>than 1 in 5 parents. Many children have also experienced <lb/>decreased effectiveness of prescription sprays in treating their <lb/>nasal allergy symptoms over weeks to months. Taken together, <lb/>these perceptions on the overall lack of full effectiveness of <lb/>INCSs and other prescription nasal sprays in many children <lb/>might result in discontinuation of medication and reduced <lb/>adherence to therapy. <lb/>Parents reported that the most bothersome side effects of <lb/>prescription nasal sprays were dripping down the throat, bad taste, <lb/>and a burning sensation, which were moderately or extremely <lb/>bothersome to many children. Often, these side effects were <lb/>sufficiently bothersome to cause the child to stop taking the <lb/>medication, request a new medication, or be nonadherent with <lb/>their physician&apos;s instructions. The survey has also identified a <lb/>number of reasons for the perceived lack of efficacy of current <lb/>prescription nasal sprays and patient dissatisfaction with disease <lb/>management. <lb/>There appears to be a general consensus among both parents <lb/>and practitioners that nasal allergy medications are lacking, <lb/>whether for reasons of ineffective relief of symptoms, slow onset <lb/>of effect, lack of 24-hour relief, or bothersome side effects. <lb/>However, more than 85% of parents of children with nasal <lb/>allergies report being generally satisfied with the nasal allergy <lb/>medication used by their child in the past 4 weeks, whether it was <lb/>an OTC medication, a prescription nasal spray, or another <lb/>prescription medication. This suggests that parents might not <lb/>have high expectations for relief of their children&apos;s nasal allergies <lb/>and do not have a preference for type of medication. HCPs, <lb/>however, overwhelmingly prefer INCSs (41%) and prescription <lb/>antihistamines (27%) to OTC medications or other prescription <lb/>medications (&lt;16%) for the treatment of their pediatric patients <lb/>with AR. <lb/>Allergies in America, a survey of adults with AR, was also <lb/>examined to identify differences in prevalence, treatment, and <lb/>other aspects of AR in children compared with adults. The <lb/>prevalence of AR was similar in adults (14%) and children (13%). <lb/>Symptoms were similar for adults and children; however, the <lb/>frequency and severity of some symptoms varied slightly between <lb/>populations. The burden of compromised sleep on daytime <lb/>activities was substantial in both populations. Additionally, both <lb/>studies support the assertion that lack of efficacy and adverse <lb/>effects of prescription nasal allergy medications affect patient <lb/>satisfaction and adherence to treatment in both adult and pediatric <lb/>populations. 7 <lb/>In addition to their effect on sleep quantity and quality, nasal <lb/>allergy symptoms can have a profound effect on children&apos;s lives <lb/>and activities. Children with AR were almost twice as likely to be <lb/>limited in their activities compared with children without AR. <lb/>Compromised health interfered with school performance in 4 of <lb/>10 children with the condition compared with only 1 in 10 <lb/>children without AR. Furthermore, parents report a nearly 30% <lb/>decrease in their children&apos;s productivity when allergy symptoms <lb/>are at their worst. <lb/>Few children can ignore allergy symptoms or tolerate their <lb/>discomfort without relief, and nearly 3 in 4 have used medication <lb/>for relief within the past 4 weeks. Although INCS sprays are <lb/>considered gold-standard pharmacotherapy for moderate-to-se-<lb/>vere allergy symptoms, only 1 in 4 children with AR use an INCS. <lb/>It also appears that despite INCSs being the pharmacologic <lb/>standard of care for AR, nearly 25% of patients remain somewhat <lb/>dissatisfied or dissatisfied with their children&apos;s INCSs compared <lb/>with only 9% of HCPs. Dissatisfaction among parents and <lb/>patients seems to stem from loss of efficacy over a 24-hour <lb/>dosing period. Many parents also report reduced efficacy over <lb/>weeks to months of INCS use. <lb/>In addition to lack of efficacy, bothersome side effects of <lb/>prescription nasal allergy sprays often lead to patient dissatisfac-<lb/>tion with medication. Bad taste and medication dripping down the <lb/>throat were the most frequently reported reasons for both <lb/>dissatisfaction with prescription nasal sprays and poor adherence <lb/>to a prescribed dosing regimen. Development of prescription <lb/>nasal sprays with formulation attributes that maximize efficacy <lb/>and duration and minimize unfavorable attributes should result in <lb/></body>

			<body>National Center for Health Statistics and the Centers for Disease <lb/>Control and Prevention, including the National Health Interview <lb/>Survey, the National Immunization Survey, the Behavioral Risk <lb/>Factor Surveillance Surveys, and the National Health and Nutrit-<lb/>ion Examination Survey (NHANES). In addition, the Interna-<lb/>tional Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) <lb/>study used a survey for the diagnosis of asthma and allergies <lb/>without diagnostic follow-up. The NHANES and ISAAC data <lb/>sets are used routinely in the medical literature to estimate the <lb/>prevalence of both asthma and AR. Although documenting IgE <lb/>sensitization would have contributed to the strength of the data by <lb/>validating the survey&apos;s ability to appropriately diagnose nasal <lb/>allergy in pediatric patients, the authors believe that the approach <lb/>used in the Pediatric Allergies in America survey (as well as the <lb/>ISAAC and NHANES surveys) is in line with current clinical <lb/>practices for an accurate diagnosis of AR. Because parental report <lb/>of nasal allergy symptoms is what physicians typically rely on in <lb/>the clinical care of children, whether in an office visit or a <lb/>telephone survey, the authors believe that the lack of an HCP-<lb/>validated diagnosis is not an insurmountable limitation of this <lb/>survey. <lb/>Furthermore, it is acknowledged that although the Pediatric <lb/>Allergies in America survey was formulated and conducted in <lb/>conjunction with the national public research organization SRBI, <lb/>the questionnaire that was used in the survey was not formally <lb/>validated. A validated test or scale is one that has been shown to <lb/>measure what it purports to measure regardless of who responds, <lb/>when they respond, and to whom they respond. The validation of <lb/>multiple-item scales has been adopted in health research to <lb/>measure multidimensional concepts, such as health (eg, Short <lb/>Form 36) and QoL, where health and QoL are key outcome <lb/>measures. By contrast, population surveys, such as Pediatric <lb/>Allergies in America, do not have &apos;&apos;validated questionnaires&apos;&apos; and <lb/>might or might not use &apos;&apos;validated scales&apos;&apos; within the question-<lb/>naire, depending on their focus. The 3 major health surveys <lb/>conducted by the federal government, the National Health <lb/>Interview Survey, the NHANES, and the Behavioral Risk Factor <lb/>Surveillance Survey, do not have validated questionnaires and <lb/>include only a few validated scales. Most of the survey findings, as <lb/>distinct from clinical trial findings reported in peer-reviewed <lb/>journals, are not based on validated questionnaires or scales. <lb/>Additionally, the primary tool used to measure efficacy in AR, the <lb/>total nasal symptom score, has never been formally validated. <lb/>Nonetheless, it is considered the gold standard in measuring the <lb/>efficacy of agents that treat AR. In this regard another way to <lb/>informally validate a questionnaire is through the repeated use of <lb/>the same questions within the same study population (in this case <lb/>patients with AR), an approach used by the Pediatric Allergies in <lb/>America survey to test the reliability of responses and to identify <lb/>ambiguity in questions. As an added precaution, the Pediatric <lb/>FIG 12. (Continued) <lb/></body>

			<body>Allergies in America survey attempted to identify the extent of <lb/>nonallergic rhinitis in our survey population by asking parents and <lb/>children whether environmental triggers suggestive of vasomotor <lb/>rhinitis (eg, fumes/odors, weather, and exercise) contributed to <lb/>their nasal allergy symptoms. Weather was identified by 19%, <lb/>fumes/odors by 7%, and exercise by 6% of respondents, suggest-<lb/>ing that nonallergic forms of the disease can contribute to the <lb/>rhinitis symptoms observed in the survey respondents. However, <lb/>at least 1 study has demonstrated that subjects diagnosed with AR <lb/>might also be affected by nonallergic triggers 66 ; therefore re-<lb/>sponse to nonallergic triggers does not preclude response to aller-<lb/>gic triggers or a valid diagnosis of AR. In contrast, a positive IgE <lb/>test result obtained by an allergist still might not rule out nonaller-<lb/>genic factors contributing to rhinitis symptoms. 67 The informal <lb/>validation approaches used in this survey (eg, incorporation of du-<lb/>plicate questions and the attempt to quantify the effect of nonal-<lb/>lergic rhinitis in our patient population) give the authors <lb/>confidence that the data obtained in this survey are valid with re-<lb/>spect to the stated goals. <lb/>The HCPs who were treating the specific pediatric patients <lb/>interviewed were not necessarily part of the survey. Not having <lb/>the patient&apos;s personal physician respond to these questions was an <lb/>inherent limitation of this survey. Although the physician respon-<lb/>dents were not specifically responding for the parent and child <lb/>respondents (a limitation of any telephone survey), the percep-<lb/>tions of the participating HCPs about their own patients are valid <lb/>and should represent their general perceptions. <lb/>In addition, information gained in this survey on diagnosis and <lb/>treatment is limited to the parent&apos;s or child&apos;s understanding of the <lb/>information and the condition. About 95% of parent respondents <lb/>and their children had health insurance. Approximately half <lb/>of parents (both allergy and nonallergy) had a household income <lb/>of more than $50,000 per year, 40% had a household income of <lb/>$50,000 per year or less, and 10% were not sure or refused to <lb/>answer the question. <lb/>Another potential limitation of a telephone survey is that, given <lb/>that 67% of the children were age 7 years or less at the time of <lb/>diagnosis, AR could not be positively distinguished from recur-<lb/>rent upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). AR has been <lb/>associated with frequent URIs, 17 and therefore even if the physi-<lb/>cian diagnosis was confirmed, one could not preclude that the fre-<lb/>quent URIs occurred because the patient&apos;s airway was inflamed as <lb/>a result of AR. Indeed, it was a noteworthy finding that few phy-<lb/>sicians used diagnostic tests to confirm allergen sensitivity, and <lb/>most patients were not seen by allergists. One factor that could <lb/>limit the possibility for misdiagnosis, however, is that the most <lb/>common time of the year for viral URIs in children is from Sep-<lb/>tember through February. This survey was performed in March <lb/>and April, months that have lower infection rates and higher <lb/>tree and grass pollination, and therefore the possibility that puta-<lb/>tive nasal allergy symptoms were in fact caused by an undiag-<lb/>nosed URI is greatly reduced. <lb/>Both physicians and parents strongly agree that better educa-<lb/>tion about AR and its treatment is necessary. The results of this <lb/>survey suggest that improvement in communication between <lb/>HCPs and parents and patients is also needed. Finally, the survey <lb/>results recommend the development of more effective, better-<lb/>tolerated treatment to improve adherence to prescribed therapy in <lb/>order to reduce the burden of allergies in both adults and children <lb/>in the United States. <lb/>We thank John O&apos;Flaherty, PhD, ProEd Communications, Inc, for his <lb/>editorial assistance with this article. <lb/>Key messages <lb/>d Pediatric Allergies in America is the largest and most <lb/>comprehensive survey of HCPs, pediatric patients, and <lb/>parents of children with allergy regarding AR and its <lb/>treatment. <lb/>d This survey has captured previously unavailable data on <lb/>the prevalence and most common symptoms of nasal <lb/>allergies, the effect of nasal allergies on children&apos;s QoL, <lb/>medication use, and factors affecting satisfaction with <lb/>treatment. <lb/>d Findings from this national survey have identified impor-<lb/>tant challenges to the management of AR, suggesting that <lb/>its burden on children in the United States has been sub-<lb/>stantially underestimated. <lb/></body>
