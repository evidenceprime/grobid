	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: The Rhinitis Symptom Utility Index (RSUI), originally developed in the United States,<lb/> consists of a patient-preference weighting scheme and a 10-item questionnaire measuring the severity and<lb/> frequency of rhinitis related symptoms over a 14-day period. This study aimed to determine whether the<lb/> Chinese RSUI could adopt the US-based multi-attribute utility function (MAUF) in scoring rhinitis<lb/> symptoms. Methods: In a Hong Kong study, 116 Chinese adults with allergic rhinitis completed the RSUI<lb/> questionnaire and 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) after they had been seen by two otorhino<lb/> laryngologists for disease-severity ratings. Respondents then completed computer-administered direct<lb/> preference measures, i.e., visual analogue scale (VAS) and standard gamble (SG) assessments. The VAS and<lb/> SG data were used to estimate a MAUF for the Chinese-based RSUI. Results: The derived MAUF was<lb/> somewhat different than the one developed for the US RSUI. Test-retest reliability for the Chinese RSUI<lb/> was satisfactory (ICC = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001). Scores differentiated among cases with mild, moderate, and severe<lb/> symptoms {p&lt; 0.001); and between those who did and did not require medications to control symptoms<lb/> (/? = 0.031). Findings were significantly correlated with SF-36 domain scores (r = 0.19 to 0.37; /? = 0.041 to<lb/> &lt; 0.001). When the US-based scoring function was applied to the Chinese subjects, the resulting mean<lb/> RSUI score was significantly lower {p&lt; 0.001). Comparisons between directly measured VAS and SG<lb/> scores between the US and Chinese samples, demonstrated significant differences (all p &lt; 0.05), with the US<lb/> subjects consistently rating rhinitis symptoms as worse than Chinese subjects. Conclusions: The Chinese<lb/> RSUI has good measurement properties that reflect patient preferences from the Chinese. Results suggest<lb/> that there are differences in preference rating between US and Chinese subjects and that use of the US<lb/> based preference function for the RSUI would bias the measurement of rhinitis symptom outcomes in<lb/> Chinese subjects.<lb/></div>
