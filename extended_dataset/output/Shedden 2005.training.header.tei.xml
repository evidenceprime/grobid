	Background: Allergic rhinitis is the most common allergic disease in the US. The predominant symptom of this Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">condition is nasal congestion, which has a significant impact on quality of life and work productivity. This large<lb/> survey was conducted to determine the impact of nasal congestion on the above parameters in individuals with<lb/> allergic rhinitis, and treatment patterns for this symptom.<lb/> Methods: Participants were recruited voluntarily via telephone surveys and internet advertisements. Respon-<lb/>dents with nasal congestion as a symptom of their allergic rhinitis (or who were primary caregivers to a child<lb/> with nasal congestion associated with allergic rhinitis) were eligible for participation and completed a 52-ques-<lb/>tion internet survey. Data were normalized to the US adult population using a weighting algorithm.<lb/> Results: Of the 2355 individuals with allergic rhinitis screened for participation in the survey, 2002 (85%) had<lb/> nasal congestion. This was considered severe by 40% of respondents, compared with fewer than 30% who<lb/> considered any other individual allergy symptom to be severe. Nasal congestion was the symptom that most<lb/> adults and children wished to prevent, and it affected most respondents at work or school, had a notable<lb/> emotional impact, and interfered with their ability to perform daily activities. Only 13% of participants receiving<lb/> allergic rhinitis medication of any type, including over-the-counter medications, claimed to be very satisfied with<lb/> treatment, and only 20% adhered completely to prescribing instructions. Although intranasal corticosteroids are<lb/> recommended as first-line therapy for nasal congestion, only 30% of respondents with severe nasal congestion<lb/> received treatment with intranasal corticosteroids.<lb/> Conclusions: Nasal congestion affects most individuals with allergic rhinitis, and has a notable impact on<lb/> quality of life, emotional function, productivity, and the ability to perform daily activities. Patients need to be<lb/> better educated on the appropriate use of medications, particularly intranasal corticosteroids, to manage their<lb/> nasal congestion.</div>
