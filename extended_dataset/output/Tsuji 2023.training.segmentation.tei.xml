			<front>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>An Exploratory Cross-sectional Study of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and <lb/>Immuno-related Adverse Events: <lb/>Knowledge and Influencing Factors among Japanese Oncology Nurses <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Objective: Adequate knowledge of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and associated <lb/>immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is essential for managing such events. However, the level <lb/>of knowledge among Japanese nurses remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the <lb/>current status of ICIs and irAE knowledge and the factors influencing them, among outpatient <lb/>nurses caring for patients undergoing ICI treatment. <lb/>Methods: An exploratory cross-sectional study was conducted at 450 facilities nationwide. <lb/>Participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire consisting of three parts, <lb/>measuring personal and environmental attributes and awareness and knowledge of irAEs. <lb/>Questions were based on multiple literature sources and were evaluated and validated by medical <lb/>oncologists and certified oncology nurses. <lb/>Results: A total of 196 (response rate: 36%) nurses responded to the survey at 109 facilities <lb/>(valid responses: 192; rate: 35%). The correct response rate was 27.6% for questions on general <lb/>ICI knowledge and 15.6% for general irAE knowledge. Questions on pulmonary dysfunction had <lb/>the highest correct response rate (41.7%), while those on neuromuscular/joint dysfunction had <lb/>the lowest (1%). The mean correct response rates were 76% for general knowledge and 48.1% <lb/>for ICI-specific knowledge. Multiple regression analysis showed that the most influential factor <lb/>was participants&apos; study schedule (p&lt;.05). <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>Conclusions: There is room for nurses to acquire additional knowledge about ICIs and irAEs. <lb/>The use of patient education tools and a study schedule significantly increased knowledge scores. <lb/>Further research is needed to identify when and how to provide nurses with opportunities to <lb/>acquire additional ICI and irAE-related knowledge. <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Cancer has been the leading cause of mortality in Japan since 1981, causing <lb/>approximately 380,000 deaths per year in 2020. 1 However, the five-year relative survival rate has <lb/>exceeded 60% since 2009. 2 <lb/>Approaches to cancer treatment have also been changing in Japan. The number of <lb/>domestic outpatients with malignant neoplasms now exceeds the number of inpatients, a trend <lb/>that has increased in recent years. 3 This change is due to a variety of factors currently occurring <lb/>in Japan, including the limited number of beds available at inpatient facilities, the promotion of <lb/>home care, and advances in cancer drug therapy. <lb/>Oncology pharmacotherapy is diversifying with the introduction of cytotoxic anticancer <lb/>agents, molecular targeted agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), all of which have <lb/>completely different mechanisms from conventional immunotherapy. 4-8 As of 2019, three ICIs <lb/>had either been approved or were undergoing clinical trials in Japan: CTLA-4 inhibitors, PD-1 <lb/>inhibitors, and PD-L1 inhibitors. These have since been approved for nine types of cancer, 4 and <lb/>clinical trials with these ICIs are being conducted for more than 25 cancer types. These trials are <lb/>expected to result in additional indications for many cancer types and stages. <lb/>The mode of action behind immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by ICI therapy <lb/>remains unknown. It is also unclear why some patients experience irAEs, while others do not. <lb/>Managing irAEs is different from managing the side effects of cytotoxic anticancer drug therapy. <lb/>This is because irAEs appear in various forms and can, theoretically, occur anywhere in the <lb/>body. Moreover, it is difficult to predict when they will appear, and delays in appropriate <lb/>response and treatment can be fatal. 4,9,10 However, there is no established treatment or supportive <lb/>care beyond the use of steroids. 4 Additionally, recent studies have shown that the risk of <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>mortality and disease progression is reduced when irAEs occur. 11,12 Thus, recognizing and <lb/>managing irAEs is a critical factor for ensuring that patients continue to receive the treatment <lb/>they require. <lb/>Against this background, nurses must have adequate knowledge of ICI treatment and any <lb/>associated irAEs. 13 However, although nurses must possess knowledge related to the medications <lb/>used for each patient, their actual acquisition of such knowledge remains insufficient. 14,15 <lb/>According to the results of a survey of 160 nurses involved in clinical practice and education in <lb/>various fields, nurses are aware of the need to provide nursing care based on evidence-based <lb/>knowledge; however, they have difficulty translating this knowledge into practice. 16 <lb/>As ICI therapy is likely to become a mainstream cancer treatment in the near future, nurses <lb/>need to acquire knowledge about ICI therapy and irAEs. However, the current status of nurses&apos; <lb/>knowledge about ICIs and irAEs and the recognition of their importance in Japan have not yet <lb/>been clarified. Furthermore, globally, there is no research or questionnaire assessing ICI and <lb/>irAE knowledge. At present, supportive care for adverse events associated with ICI therapy has <lb/>not been established. As such, it is vital for nurses to have appropriate knowledge regarding <lb/>irAEs to ensure early detection and treatment, thereby reducing distress among patients and their <lb/>families. An appropriate level of knowledge is also needed to ensure that effective treatment can <lb/>be safely continued and sufficient therapeutic effects are realized. <lb/>This study aimed to test the following research hypotheses by examining knowledge of <lb/>ICIs and irAEs-and the factors affecting that knowledge-among outpatient nurses involved in <lb/>the care of patients undergoing ICI treatment in Japan. This study seeks to contribute to the field <lb/>by analyzing the hypotheses based on a conceptual diagram of knowledge, attributes, and <lb/>awareness of irAEs (Figure). Since no theoretical framework existed, the conceptual diagram <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>was originally schematized by the author. Knowledge of ICIs and irAEs is associated with <lb/>personal attributes and environmental characteristics. Awareness of irAEs is associated with <lb/>personal attributes, environmental characteristics, and knowledge of ICIs and irAEs. Personal <lb/>attributes are in turn associated with environmental characteristics. <lb/>Hypothesis 1: Nurses who study ICIs and irAEs gain adequate knowledge compared to <lb/>those who do not. <lb/>Hypothesis 2: Knowledge of ICIs and irAEs among nurses involved in ICI treatment <lb/>would be associated with nurses&apos; personal attributes, such as irAE management training <lb/>participants, providing opportunities for learning about irAEs, and the number of ICI-<lb/>administered patients involved in care to date. A null hypothesis will be tested to the effect that <lb/>there is no association between knowledge of irAEs and nurses&apos; personal attributes, such as irAE <lb/>management training participants, providing opportunities for learning about irAEs, and the <lb/>number of ICI-administered patients involved in care. <lb/>Hypothesis 3: Knowledge of ICIs and irAEs among nurses involved in ICI treatment <lb/>would be associated between two groups of nurses&apos; environmental characteristics, such as the <lb/>presence of an in-house multidisciplinary team, certified cancer-related personnel, and an ICI-<lb/>specific questionnaire in the facility. A null hypothesis will be tested to the effect that there is no <lb/>association between knowledge of irAEs and nurses&apos; environmental characteristics, such as the <lb/>presence of an in-house multidisciplinary team, certified cancer-related personnel, and an ICI-<lb/>specific questionnaire in the facility. <lb/>2. Methods <lb/>2.1 Design <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>This was an exploratory cross-sectional study using an internet-based self-administered <lb/>questionnaire. <lb/>2.2 Setting <lb/>A total of 450 facilities in Japan were included in this study, including 447 designated <lb/>comprehensive cancer centers and 86 advanced treatment hospitals that do not overlap with the <lb/>designated comprehensive cancer centers. 17,18 <lb/>A research request letter, a sample questionnaire, a sample research cooperation request <lb/>form for cooperating nurses, and a reply-paid postcard were sent to the head of the nursing <lb/>department of the facility where the survey was conducted. The return postcards were sent by the <lb/>head of the nursing department of the facility where the survey was to be conducted, with the <lb/>name of the person in charge of accepting the survey and the number of possible collaborators <lb/>indicated. Based on the returned postcards, a &quot;Request for Research Cooperation Form&quot; was <lb/>mailed to the person in charge of accepting the survey at facilities that agreed to cooperate. The <lb/>form included the purpose of the study and the URL and 2D code to access the Internet survey <lb/>for the cooperating nurses. The research coordinator distributed this form to nurses who were <lb/>involved in ICI administration nursing in the outpatient chemotherapy centers and outpatient <lb/>treatment centers of gastroenterology and respiratory medicine, or similar departments, and <lb/>requested their responses via the Internet. <lb/>The data collection period was from June to September 2020. <lb/>2.3 Participants <lb/>The survey targets were nurses working in departments involved in the care of patients <lb/>undergoing ICI treatment at the concerned facilities. The survey did not ask whether participants <lb/>held certifications, such as certified cancer chemotherapy nursing or cancer nursing specialist in <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>oncology. <lb/>2.4 Sample Size Calculation <lb/>The total number of items calculated for the sample size was 35, which included 10 main <lb/>attribute items from the 26 attribute items considered and selected to be particularly influential <lb/>on irAE management, eight awareness items (7 questions and 1 free comment), nine items <lb/>testing knowledge about ICIs and irAEs, and eight items on the various types of irAEs. The <lb/>required minimum sample size was set at 175, five times the number of items. 19 Assuming that <lb/>the response rate will be 25%, the number of required participants was calculated to be 700 <lb/>(=175/0.25). The number of facilities requested was calculated to be 281 (=70/0.25) assuming a <lb/>minimum of 70 facilities and a response rate of 25%, based on the assumption that 10 nurses <lb/>from one facility would respond to the survey. <lb/>2.5 Questionnaire <lb/>2.5.1 Test of ICI and irAE Knowledge <lb/>Questions related to basic knowledge of ICIs and irAEs were based on the Cancer <lb/>Immunotherapy Guidelines (second edition), 4 National Comprehensive Cancer Network <lb/>guidelines, 6 and previous studies. 8,17,18.20-26 The survey consisted of ten items meant to extract <lb/>participants&apos; basic knowledge about ICIs and irAEs, specific symptoms of irAEs by area, <lb/>frequency of occurrence, severity (mortality rate), and urgency as well as specific symptom <lb/>measures and non-steroidal treatment. Knowledge scores were based on whether participants <lb/>answered the true/false questions correctly. <lb/>Nine oncologists, pulmonary physicians, oncology certificated nurse specialists, and <lb/>certified cancer chemotherapy nurses were asked to evaluate the content validity of the ICI and <lb/>irAE knowledge test in terms of appropriateness, difficulty, necessity, and modifications. The <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>appropriateness, difficulty, and necessity of each item were rated on a three-point Likert-type <lb/>scale (3, high; 2, neither; 1, low); the mean scores were 2.4, 2.1, and 2.7, respectively. <lb/>Modifications were made based on these results. <lb/>A pilot survey of the modified ICI and irAE knowledge test was conducted with three <lb/>nurses working at a designated comprehensive cancer center. The items were then re-examined <lb/>and finalized. <lb/>2.5.2 Awareness of irAEs <lb/>Eight questions related to irAE awareness were set by referring to the item on side effects <lb/>in the &quot;31 items of nursing practice for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,&quot; 14 replacing <lb/>chemotherapy and its associated side effects with ICIs and irAEs, respectively. The response <lb/>format was a five-point Likert scale. <lb/>The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) 27 was applied to set up the answers for question 7, <lb/>&quot;plan to learn about irAEs.&quot; <lb/>2.5.3 Attributes (Personal Attributes and Environmental Characteristics) <lb/>A total of 26 items were asked based on multiple sources, including 20 items related to <lb/>personal attributes and six related to environmental characteristics that are considered influential <lb/>in the acquisition of cancer care expertise. Participants were asked to select applicable items or <lb/>write freely. <lb/>2.6 Data Analysis <lb/>We performed a variance, correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis with <lb/>attributes (personal attributes and environmental characteristics) and awareness of irAEs (7 <lb/>questions and 1 free comment) as the independent variables and irAE knowledge test scores as <lb/>the dependent variable. <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>The knowledge test score was calculated as one point for each of the 41 questions in the <lb/>ten domains, resulting in a total of 41 points for the knowledge test score. Additionally, each of <lb/>the irAE question options (Q3 through Q10: total 32 options) was divided into two categories <lb/>(except Q1 and Q2, which were ICI-related questions): knowledge required for general cancer <lb/>nursing (12 options) and knowledge required for nursing specific to ICI (20 options), with one <lb/>point each for a total of 32 points. The average percentage of correct answers was calculated. <lb/>SPSS Statistics version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for analysis, and the <lb/>significance level was set at .05%. <lb/>In accordance with the hypothesis, the knowledge test scores on ICIs and irAEs were used <lb/>as the dependent variable and the other variables were used as independent variables to examine <lb/>the influencing factors. <lb/>2.7 Ethical Considerations <lb/>This study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Research Ethics Review <lb/>Committee of an international university (approval no. 20-A018). All participants provided <lb/>written informed consent. <lb/>3. Results <lb/>3.1 The Number of Survey Participants and Response Rate <lb/>We sent a letter in advance to 281 nurse directors at the target facilities, which were <lb/>randomly selected from 450 eligible facilities, requesting their participation. Nurse directors <lb/>approached nurses who were involved in ICI administration nursing in the outpatient department, <lb/>where cancer patients with indications for ICIs are treated. We sent 538 request letters to 109 <lb/>facilities (63%) that agreed to cooperate (38%). We received responses from 196 (36%), and 192 <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>valid responses were obtained (valid response rate: 35%). Table 1 summarizes the basic <lb/>attributes of the participants. <lb/>3.2 General Data <lb/>Table 1 summarizes the basic attributes of the participants. <lb/>3.3 Nurses` Knowledge Level <lb/>Table 2 presents the results of the ICI and irAE knowledge test. The mean score was 26.2 <lb/>out of 41 (63.9% correct, standard deviation (SD) 5.48), and the median score was 26.5. Among <lb/>the individual questions, nine questions on ICI and irAE general knowledge were excluded <lb/>because they combined the two types of knowledge, preventing individual measurement of ICI-<lb/>and irAE-specific knowledge. The remaining questions were divided into ICI-or irAE-specific <lb/>knowledge (20 questions, &quot;a&quot; in Table 2) and general knowledge necessary for cancer nursing <lb/>(12 questions, &quot;b&quot; in Table 2). The average percentage of correct answers for general knowledge <lb/>of cancer nursing was higher than the average percentage of total correct answers, while the <lb/>average percentage of correct answers for ICI-specific knowledge was lower. This was also true <lb/>for the percentage of correct answers for each of the irAE topics; the percentage of correct <lb/>answers was higher for the general knowledge questions and lower for the questions with more <lb/>ICI-specific options. The irAE topics that exceeded the average percentage of correct answers for <lb/>all questions were pulmonary dysfunction (41.7%) and hepatic dysfunction (27.1%). The <lb/>reliability coefficient (Cronbach&apos;s alpha) for the knowledge test was 0.79. <lb/>3.4 Influencing Factors: Single Factor Analysis <lb/>3.4.1 Personal Attributes and Environmental Characteristics Associated with Knowledge <lb/>Test Scores <lb/>The relationships between the knowledge test scores and the nominal variables of personal <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>attributes and environmental characteristics are shown in Table 3. The significant personal <lb/>attributes were the number of beds, current department, certification held, highest level of <lb/>nursing educational background, academic society affiliation, participation in irAE management <lb/>training, experience with currently predictable irAEs, experience with currently unpredictable <lb/>irAEs, existence of free self-study, existence of paid self-study, and affiliation with ICI-related <lb/>multidisciplinary teams in the hospital. The significant environmental characteristics were the <lb/>presence of certified personnel in the hospital, use of an ICI-specific questionnaire, and presence <lb/>of a patient education tool (p &lt; .05). <lb/>The continuous variables of personal attributes and environmental characteristics that were <lb/>correlated with ICI and irAE knowledge test scores by correlation coefficients were significantly <lb/>different by years of experience in cancer nursing, number of certifications held, number of <lb/>academic society affiliations, number of free self-study opportunities/modes, number of paid <lb/>self-study opportunities/modes, number of in-hospital certified personnel, number of irAE <lb/>confirmation tools, and number of patient education tools. The correlation coefficients were <lb/>weak, ranging from 0.2 to 0.4. <lb/>The ICI and irAE knowledge test scores for irAE management training participants were <lb/>significantly higher, with a mean score of 28.5 (SD 4.80) and a median score of 29, than the <lb/>scores of participants who had not participated in such training. <lb/>In terms of the mean and median scores for the number of self-learning <lb/>opportunities/modes, there was a difference in scores between the &quot;free&quot; group with two or fewer <lb/>opportunities/modes and the &quot;paid&quot; group with three or more opportunities/modes. There was <lb/>also a difference between the paid group with one or no opportunities/modes and the paid group <lb/>with two or more opportunities/modes. Therefore, we set up groups according to the number of <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>items for which a difference in scores was observed: two or fewer and three or more for the free <lb/>group, and one or more for the paid group. We then compared these groups using Mann-<lb/>Whitney U tests. The results showed that there was a significant difference in knowledge <lb/>depending on the number of free self-study opportunities/modes (between two or fewer and three <lb/>or more [p=.000]) and the number of paid self-study opportunities/modes (between one or no <lb/>opportunities and two or more [p=.004]). <lb/>Those with fewer than five years of clinical experience (n=4) scored higher on the <lb/>knowledge test (mean 30.5 SD 5.74, median 31). However, those with fewer than five years of <lb/>oncology nursing experience (n=44, mean 18 years of clinical experience) scored lower (mean <lb/>23.7 SD 7.84, median 21). Although there was no significant difference in knowledge test scores <lb/>for either years of clinical experience or of oncology nursing experience, correct responses were <lb/>higher in the group with six or more years of clinical experience than in that with one to five <lb/>years of experience. Scores were also higher for those with oncology nursing experience than for <lb/>those without. <lb/>Based on the results of the above analysis, the personal attributes and environmental <lb/>characteristics that were related or correlated with the knowledge test scores were certifications <lb/>held, academic society affiliation, free self-learning opportunities/media, irAE confirmation <lb/>tools, and patient education tools. <lb/>Regarding learning status, participants with previously predicted and unpredicted irAEs <lb/>used multiple self-learning opportunities/modes. Furthermore, more than two-thirds of them <lb/>indicated that they were already engaged in learning (more than six months and six months or <lb/>under). <lb/>3.4.2 Examination of Awareness of irAEs as Related to Knowledge Test Scores <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>The relationships between ICI and irAE knowledge test scores and awareness of irAEs are <lb/>shown in Table 4. Free comments (n=23) on the awareness of irAEs are shown in Table 5; the <lb/>relationships between ICI and irAE knowledge test scores could not be analyzed due to <lb/>insufficient data. The results showed that independence was dismissed in knowledge test scores <lb/>and awareness of irAEs, with &quot;calling on oneself to identify irAEs,&quot; &quot;patient education on the <lb/>purpose of irAE prevention and coping behaviors is important,&quot; &quot;improving knowledge of the <lb/>antitumor effects and adverse events of the drugs administered to each patient is important,&quot; and <lb/>&quot;learning schedule for irAEs&quot; were significantly different (p &lt; .05). Hence, an association was <lb/>observed. <lb/>No association was found between &quot;early detection of irAEs is the physician&apos;s role&quot; and <lb/>knowledge test scores. There was a significant difference between the &quot;agree&quot; and &quot;neither agree <lb/>nor disagree&quot; groups (multiple comparison method). The &quot;neither agree nor disagree&quot; group had <lb/>higher knowledge test scores. &quot;It is the physician&apos;s role&quot; and &quot;it is not the physician&apos;s role&quot; <lb/>groups had lower scores than the &quot;neither agree nor disagree&quot; group. <lb/>The &quot;plan to learn&quot; item of the awareness of irAE variable was the most relevant to <lb/>knowledge test scores on ICIs and irAEs. <lb/>3.4.3 Influencing Factors: Multiple Regression Analysis <lb/>The multiple linear regression analysis results are shown in Table 6. We used a forced <lb/>imputation method to examine the relationship between ICI and irAE knowledge test scores and <lb/>the significant variables of attribute and irAE awareness. <lb/>Therefore, the standardized coefficients (β) of each of the variables in the questionnaire <lb/>showed that &quot;plan to learn&quot; and &quot;certifications held&quot; influenced the knowledge test scores, but <lb/>the significant probability was p &lt; .05 for &quot;plan to learn.&quot; <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>4. Discussion <lb/>In this section, we examine the relationship between the items based on the obtained <lb/>results and discuss future strategies for nurses to acquire knowledge. <lb/>4.1 Characteristics of the Target Population <lb/>More than 70% of the participants were nurses in their 40s or older and working in <lb/>medium-sized or larger facilities. This sample is slightly older than the general population of <lb/>nurses in Japan, where just under 50% of hospital nurses are in their 40s or older. 28 More than <lb/>70% of the nurses had experience of caring for more than 21 patients on ICI therapy, and nearly <lb/>90% of the nurses worked in outpatient chemotherapy units, suggesting that this is a group <lb/>involved in cancer drug therapy daily. <lb/>4.2 Nurses` Knowledge Level <lb/>As described earlier, the reliability coefficient (Cronbach&apos;s alpha) for the knowledge test <lb/>was 0.79. Therefore, the knowledge test used in this study remained reliable, and we believe it <lb/>was appropriate for measuring nurses&apos; knowledge on ICIs and irAEs in this aspect. Additionally, <lb/>in terms of awareness of irAEs, nearly 35% of the participants who answered &quot;already learning <lb/>(more than six months)&quot; to the question &quot;plan to learn about irAEs&quot; scored significantly higher <lb/>(mean 29.07, SD 3.95, median 30) than who did not. This suggests that the test was an <lb/>appropriate measure of the knowledge of those accessing learning opportunities. <lb/>As per the result shown, in each of the irAE categories, only two categories had a higher-<lb/>than-average percentage of all questions answered correctly on the knowledge test: pulmonary <lb/>dysfunction (41.7%) and hepatic dysfunction (27.1%). We believe that the pulmonary <lb/>dysfunction knowledge score was the highest because of rising awareness among nurses about <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>reports of deaths because of the interstitial pulmonary dysfunction associated with ICI treatment <lb/>and also because the mortality rate of drug-induced pulmonary dysfunction due to cancer drug <lb/>therapy in Japan is higher than that in other countries. 30 Based on the above, the probability that <lb/>nurses have been involved in the care of patients with cancer who develop drug-induced <lb/>pulmonary dysfunction is high, so it can be inferred that nurses are aware of this problem. <lb/>In contrast, the knowledge scores for dermatological dysfunction (47.2%), <lb/>neurologic/musculoskeletal dysfunction (39.2%), endocrine dysfunction (46.3%), and cardiac <lb/>dysfunction (48.3%) were below the average percentage of each question answered correctly. In <lb/>these areas, a lack of penetration of disease-specific knowledge may be a factor. This is because <lb/>the incidence of irAE itself is in the single digits, and a variety of diseases are included in this <lb/>area. Although endocrine dysfunction also includes a variety of diseases, 56% of the participants <lb/>correctly answered, &quot;(c.) thyroid dysfunction is the least frequent endocrine dysfunction among <lb/>irAEs (incorrect).&quot; 4,6,7,20-22 It is assumed that the participants were aware of thyroid dysfunction, <lb/>which is relatively frequent among irAEs; this led to the acquisition of knowledge. For cardiac <lb/>dysfunction, the result indicates that the acquisition of knowledge about the general <lb/>cardiovascular system is also an issue. <lb/>The distinctive results showed that correct response rates for gastrointestinal and <lb/>dermatological dysfunction, which are considered to occur more frequently among irAEs, 4,6,7,21-<lb/>23 were lower than those for neurologic/musculoskeletal dysfunction. The incidence of <lb/>gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by ICIs is estimated to be 30%-40%, and fatalities, such as <lb/>those resulting from intestinal perforation, have been reported. Unlike gastrointestinal disorders <lb/>caused by cytotoxic anticancer drugs, the use of antidiarrheal agents may delay treatment for <lb/>irAEs and cause serious complications. 4,6-8 However, the item-specific correct response rate was <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>low. <lb/>In this knowledge test, questions related to general clinical symptoms and care were <lb/>avoided as much as possible because the target audience was nurses who were already engaged <lb/>in clinical practice. The test was composed of questions related to specialized knowledge of ICIs <lb/>and irAEs as well as specific clinical symptoms and responses. Furthermore, the percentage of <lb/>correct answers to irAE-specific questions, such as the frequency, timing, severity, and grade of <lb/>irAEs, was low. Therefore, it can be considered that the participants lacked knowledge of ICIs <lb/>and irAEs. <lb/>According to the above data, we analyzed that nurses caring for cancer patients <lb/>undergoing ICI treatment need to further improve their basic knowledge of ICIs and irAEs <lb/>especially the frequency of incidence or are prone to become severe irAEs. Furthermore, the <lb/>study found that nurses urgently need to acquire knowledge about low occurrence fatal irAEs. <lb/>For preventing irAEs, it is significant to first know the immune-toxicity spectrum 13 , especially <lb/>for early detection of irAEs, which is one of the most significant roles of nurses caring for <lb/>patients undergoing ICI treatment. <lb/>4.3 Influencing Factors of the Knowledge Test Scores and Attributes <lb/>The ICI and irAE knowledge test scores for irAE management training participants were <lb/>significantly higher than the scores of participants who had not participated in such training <lb/>programs. Although participation in training programs is an effective means of acquiring <lb/>knowledge, further intervention studies are needed because nurses who already possess the <lb/>required knowledge may participate in training programs to acquire further knowledge. <lb/>Nurses who engaged in self-learning had significantly higher knowledge test scores than <lb/>those who did not. On the contrary, there was no significant difference in knowledge test scores <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>when only a single learning opportunity or mode was accessed, and the knowledge test scores <lb/>were significantly higher when three or more free learning opportunities or modes were accessed <lb/>or two or more paid learning opportunities or modes were accessed. This suggests that the use of <lb/>multiple self-learning systems possibly in combination with a paid system will enable effective <lb/>learning for knowledge acquisition. <lb/>Furthermore, the knowledge test scores were significantly higher for participants who <lb/>answered &quot;yes&quot; to the questions on experience with predictable or unpredictable irAEs than for <lb/>those who answered &quot;no&quot; to predictable irAEs. In other words, those who indicated that they had <lb/>experience with predictable or unpredictable irAEs had already acquired knowledge of irAEs and <lb/>were likely to provide nursing care with awareness of irAEs. <lb/>The results of this study showed a trend in terms of the extent of experience and <lb/>institutional attributes of the target population; working in a specialized comprehensive cancer <lb/>center did not significantly affect the level of expertise. Additionally, nurses working in general <lb/>hospitals and university hospitals maintain their knowledge due to diverse associations. Although <lb/>the sample size was small, the knowledge test scores were higher in those with fewer than five <lb/>years of clinical experience (n=4; mean 30.5, SD 5.74, median 31). We can assume that after <lb/>they graduated from a nursing educational institution, they were assigned to an outpatient <lb/>chemotherapy center or outpatient department as nurses with recently updated knowledge. <lb/>There was no significant difference in knowledge test scores according to the number of <lb/>years of clinical experience or the number of years of oncology nursing experience. However, <lb/>the percentage of correct answers increased with the number of years of clinical experience. <lb/>There was also no significant difference in knowledge test scores according to the number of <lb/>years of experience working in comprehensive cancer centers or chemotherapy centers. <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>Furthermore, those with six to ten years of experience working in comprehensive cancer centers <lb/>had the lowest scores compared to the overall group without work experience in comprehensive <lb/>cancers. Additionally, the scores of those with fewer than five years of oncology nursing <lb/>experience (n=44; mean 18 years of clinical experience) were the lowest (mean 23.7, SD 7.84, <lb/>median 21). These results suggest that nurses&apos; knowledge acquisition is highly influenced by the <lb/>environment in which they are placed, for instance the availability of ICI-specific questionnaires <lb/>and patient education tools. <lb/>Nurses using ICI-specific questionnaires, irAE confirmation tool, and patient education <lb/>tool had significantly higher knowledge test scores than those who did not. As nurses use these <lb/>tools to make direct explanations to patients, it is highly likely that nurses learn about irAEs <lb/>ahead of time, before explaining them to patients, or that they learn about them through such <lb/>patient explanations. This will likely be an opportunity to acquire knowledge not only for nurses <lb/>with limited experience, as mentioned earlier, but also for nurses involved in such situations. <lb/>4.4 Influencing Factors of Knowledge and Awareness of irAEs <lb/>Participants who answered &quot;agree (it is important)&quot; to the questions on the importance of <lb/>talking to patients, educating patients, and improving their own knowledge had significantly <lb/>higher knowledge test scores. It can be assumed that a high knowledge test score is a result of <lb/>learning, which further results in confidence in nursing. It can also be assumed that nurses select <lb/>and implement appropriate nursing care based on specific information, theories, and methods; <lb/>that is, the patient is approached and the irAE is confirmed. 29 <lb/>There was a significant difference in the response to the question on whether early <lb/>detection of irAEs is the physician&apos;s responsibility when an in-house ICI-related <lb/>multidisciplinary team exists. Moreover, the presence of qualified personnel in the hospital, or in <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>a nurse&apos;s own department, was significantly related to nurses talking to patients themselves; <lb/>however, no significant relationship was found with &quot;plan to learn.&quot; <lb/>4.5 Future Suggestions for Knowledge Acquisition <lb/>Regarding the question on &quot;plan to learn&quot; in the questions on awareness of irAEs, the <lb/>transtheoretical model (TTM) 32 was used. The finding indicates that further research is needed to <lb/>determine the kind of approach that should be adopted in the future to educate the 30% who were <lb/>in the contemplation and precontemplation stages. In this study, nearly 95% of the nurses <lb/>indicated that they used free learning opportunities/modes for self-improvement, including <lb/>seminars, lectures, training sessions, conference-produced materials, and e-learning. The TTM <lb/>considers the use of these modes to be part of the preparation stage. <lb/>Additionally, computerized interactive interventions may lead to significant results in <lb/>terms of behavior changes. 27 Digital tools such as apps and social networking sites, which were <lb/>among the answer choices for learning opportunities/modes currently used, were not mentioned <lb/>in the survey results. However, the participants freely stated that they would learn if online <lb/>learning materials and tools were available or if they had the time and schedule flexibility to <lb/>participate. Thus, it is possible that on-demand digital tools that are interactive and can be <lb/>completed at any pace, according to one&apos;s own convenience, would be useful. <lb/>4.6 Limitations and Future Challenges <lb/>As mentioned earlier, the content of the irAE knowledge test was extracted from the <lb/>Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines 4 and relevant literature. 6-8,20-22,31,32 The test was then <lb/>confirmed by an expert panel. However, further validation is needed to evaluate the reliability of <lb/>the test as a knowledge test on ICIs and irAEs. Additionally, further research is needed to <lb/>evaluate the correct response rate of this test, including validation and different target groups. <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>In this survey, about 90% of the participants were nurses who care for patients <lb/>undergoing anticancer drug therapy in outpatient chemotherapy units or outpatient infusion <lb/>centers. In the future, it will be necessary to devise recruitment methods so that more nurses who <lb/>provide cancer nursing care at general outpatient clinics or best supportive care units can be <lb/>included. The reason is that most patients receiving ICI treatment have intervals between <lb/>administration (two to six weeks 20,21 ); irAEs may occur late after the completion of <lb/>treatment, 4,9,20-22 and the occurrence of irAEs may require permanent treatment for irAEs. <lb/>Additionally, ICIs may be combined with other cancer drugs or radiation therapy based on new <lb/>regimen approvals. The management of irAEs resulting from ICIs requires educating patients <lb/>prior to treatment and providing ongoing support through multiple methods tailored to each <lb/>patient. 13,31 In parallel, nurses need to know what to ask and how to respond to patients, and they <lb/>must have experience and knowledge of the treatment and underlying disease so that they can <lb/>distinguish complications. 33 Nurses play a role not only in preventing physical deterioration <lb/>through early detection of irAEs but also in supporting patients to continue the necessary or <lb/>desired treatment over the mid-to-long-term period. Considering the above, it is necessary to <lb/>further verify the results of this study by conducting an additional survey that fully addresses the <lb/>context of these participants. <lb/>5. Conclusion <lb/>This study revealed that there is room for nurses to acquire more knowledge about ICIs <lb/>and irAEs, as ICI pharmacotherapy occupies an important position in cancer treatment. <lb/>Based on the suggestions from the study findings and in light of the above, specific <lb/>consideration should be given to computerized interactive tools that are appropriate to the <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/>nurses&apos; stage of knowledge acquisition, to building an ICI-related multidisciplinary team or a <lb/>potential substitute for such a team at hospitals, and to increasing nurses&apos; awareness of their role <lb/>in confronting patients by providing specific information on how appropriate feedback and <lb/>change can lead to positive outcomes for patients. A challenge for the future is to build multiple <lb/>effective knowledge acquisition opportunities through patient education tools, questionnaires, <lb/>and other direct patient media and linking them to behavior change. Based on the present results, <lb/>the possibility of clinical application to the acquisition of knowledge in other fields and other <lb/>treatment methods should also be considered. <lb/>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f <lb/></body>
