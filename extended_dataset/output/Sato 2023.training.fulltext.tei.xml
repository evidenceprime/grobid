			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PCC), located at the hep-<lb/>atic hilum, is the most common type of biliary cancer. <ref type="biblio">1<lb/></ref> Choosing a suitable treatment strategy for PCC is a<lb/> major priority due to its complex origin, where all hepatic<lb/> ducts, arteries, and portal veins gather. Surgical resec-<lb/>tion is the only way to cure PCC, as in most solid tumors.<lb/> However, PCC resection requires significant expertise<lb/> and is associated with high mortality, resulting in a 5-<lb/>year survival rate below 50%. <ref type="biblio">2,3</ref> R0 resection is one of<lb/> the strongest prognostic factors for the surgical treat-<lb/>ment of PCC. Clarifying the extent of biliary invasion<lb/> in individual hepatic ducts is essential for determin-<lb/>ing the possibility of surgical R0 resection. <ref type="biblio">4</ref> The Bis-<lb/>muth classification, focusing on secondary branch inva-<lb/>sion, is often used to classify the extent of biliary inva-<lb/>sion in PCC. <ref type="biblio">5</ref> Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-<lb/>atography (ERCP) plays a significant role in clarifying<lb/> the extent of invasion both by precise imaging of the<lb/> entire intra-and extrahepatic bile duct and by patholog-<lb/>ical diagnosis via step biopsy. The indication for surgi-<lb/>cal resection differs between hospitals, and appropriate<lb/> ERCP strategies are based on each center&apos;s criteria.<lb/></p>

			<p>Biliary obstruction and jaundice are common char-<lb/>acteristics associated with PCC. Preoperative biliary<lb/> drainage of the future remnant liver improves liver<lb/> function and enhances regenerative capacities of the<lb/> liver. Incomplete drainage of the remnant liver is<lb/> a mortality risk when the future remnant liver vol-<lb/>ume is below 50%. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> In addition, selective drainage<lb/> of infected segments of the liver decreases mor-<lb/>bidity after hepatectomy. <ref type="biblio">7</ref> A meta-analysis supporting<lb/> preoperative drainage has been reported, suggesting<lb/> that preoperative drainage may decrease postoperative<lb/> morbidity. <ref type="biblio">8</ref> In contrast, biliary drainage has been repeat-<lb/>edly shown to increase postoperative infection-related<lb/> adverse events. 9,10 Cholangitis has been observed<lb/> in 68% of patients with biliary drainage and 0% of<lb/> patients without preoperative drainage. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> In a meta-<lb/>analysis focusing on the effect of preoperative cholan-<lb/>gitis on PCC, preoperative cholangitis was associated<lb/> with postoperative mortality, morbidity, risk of liver fail-<lb/>ure, and infection. <ref type="biblio">11</ref> There are pros and cons of pre-<lb/>operative biliary drainage, as shown above; however, in<lb/> Japanese clinical practice, preoperative biliary drainage<lb/> is widely performed and expected to benefit patients<lb/> with hepatectomy. <ref type="biblio">12<lb/></ref> The aim of our study was to clarify the drainage-<lb/>related prognostic factors within the diagnostic period<lb/> from the viewpoints of endoscopists.</p>

			<figure>Biliary drainage<lb/> and diagnostic ERCP are essential features of PCC<lb/> diagnosis and treatment. Previous reports concern-<lb/>ing PCC have focused mainly on surgical resec-<lb/>tion and presurgical factors, and few reports have<lb/> emphasized the importance of factors associated with<lb/> ERCP. Repeated and inappropriate drainage may trig-<lb/>ger cholangitis, which increases postoperative morbidity<lb/> and interrupts chemotherapy. Identifying the drainage-<lb/>related risks associated with PCC will help those per-<lb/>forming ERCP determine what should be done and what<lb/> must be avoided in the primary drainage and diagnosis<lb/> of suspected PCC.<lb/></figure>

			<head>METHODS<lb/> Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>Consecutive patients diagnosed with or treated for PCC<lb/> at Osaka University Hospital from January 2010 to<lb/> February 2020 were included. All patients experienced<lb/> prior expert conferences, and PCC was described as<lb/> the major prognostic factor. The patients eligible for the<lb/> study were identified from our hospital databases and<lb/> were retrospectively reviewed. This study adhered to the<lb/> Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Insti-<lb/>tutional Review Board of Osaka University (Approval<lb/> Number: 16318).<lb/></p>

			<head>Definitions<lb/></head>

			<p>Patients with a pathological diagnosis of or presumed<lb/> PCC according to expert conferences were diagnosed<lb/> with PCC. We defined the first biliary drainage attempt<lb/> performed against suspected PCCs as the first drainage.<lb/> Details of the final drainage are described below. In<lb/> surgically treated patients, drainage just before hepa-<lb/>tectomy, preoperative hospital discharge, or success-<lb/>ful neoadjuvant chemotherapy induction represented<lb/> the final drainage. In unresectable patients receiving<lb/> chemotherapy, biliary drainage in which chemotherapy<lb/> could be started and that was associated with hospi-<lb/>tal discharge was referred to as final biliary drainage. In<lb/> patients receiving best supportive care, biliary drainage<lb/> performed just before the best supportive care deci-<lb/>sion was used as the final drainage. For our investiga-<lb/>tion of diagnostic ERCP and biliary drainage performed<lb/> primarily on suspected PCCs, we defined the period<lb/> between the date of the first drainage and final drainage<lb/> as the diagnostic period (Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). Endoscopists with<lb/> experience of 6-8 years started every ERCP session,<lb/> and experts took cover according to the difficulty of the<lb/> examination.<lb/></p>

			<p>Cholangitis was diagnosed according to the Tokyo<lb/> Guidelines 2018. <ref type="biblio">13</ref> Prediagnostic cholangitis was<lb/> defined as cholangitis before the first drainage, including<lb/> at the time of the first visit to the hospital. Drainage-<lb/>related cholangitis was defined as new cholangitis that<lb/> emerged after the first biliary drainage attempt within<lb/> the diagnostic period. In patients with prediagnostic<lb/> cholangitis, new cholangitis that occurred after pre-<lb/>diagnostic cholangitis had resolved was considered<lb/> drainage-related cholangitis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Successful biliary drainage was defined as a<lb/> decrease in the total bilirubin level by 50% or reach-<lb/>ing the normal limit within 14 days. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> To simplify the<lb/> drainage area, we divided the liver into three segments,<lb/> namely, the left lobe, anterior segment, and posterior<lb/> segment, and addressed each segment as being of<lb/> equal value within this study. Post-ERCP pancreatitis<lb/> was defined as an amylase level three times the normal<lb/> limit 24 h after ERCP and concomitant abdominal pain.<lb/> Severity was scored according to Cotton&apos;s criteria. <ref type="biblio">15<lb/></ref> Overall survival (OS) was the time from the first visit<lb/> to the hospital with assumed PCC to the date of death<lb/> regardless of the cause or the last date of the hospital<lb/> visit. Time to diagnosis was the time from the first visit to<lb/> the hospital with suspected PCC to the date of the first<lb/> pathological diagnosis. For staging, the criteria of the 6th<lb/> version of the general rules for clinical and pathologi-<lb/>cal studies on cancer of the bile duct published by the<lb/> Japanese Society of Hepatobiliary-Pancreatic Surgery<lb/> were used. Staging and Bismuth classification were<lb/> identified clinically with contrast-enhanced multidetec-<lb/>tor computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging<lb/> before drainage or ERCP. Clinical lymph node metas-<lb/>tasis was defined as fluorine-18 deoxyglucose accu-<lb/>mulation with positron emission tomography-computed<lb/> tomography (CT) or a minor diameter over 10 mm based<lb/> on CT.<lb/></p>

			<head>Outcome measurement<lb/></head>

			<p>The primary endpoint of this study was to clarify the<lb/> drainage-related prognostic factors within the diagnostic<lb/> period. We focused mainly on the factors related to diag-<lb/>nosis and biliary drainage from the viewpoints of endo-<lb/>scopists. The variables associated with patient charac-<lb/>teristics and ERCP procedures were retrospectively col-<lb/>lected based on medical records.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>The data are shown as median values with the range or<lb/> IQR unless otherwise specified. For the univariate anal-<lb/>ysis, the Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous<lb/> variables, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for ordi-<lb/>nal scale variables, and the chi-square test was used for<lb/> categorical variables. A Cox proportional hazard model<lb/> was used for univariate and multivariate analyses of<lb/> prognostic factors. A logistic regression model was used<lb/> for multivariate analysis to analyze the risk of related<lb/> factors. For the multivariate analysis, factors shown to<lb/> be significant in the univariate analysis were applied. OS<lb/> was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and sta-<lb/>tistically evaluated by the log-rank test. A p-value below<lb/> 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses<lb/> were performed with JMP Pro 15 (SAS Institute Inc.,<lb/> Tokyo, Japan).<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/> Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>A total of 119 patients were presumed to have PCC<lb/> from January 2010 to February 2020 at Osaka Univer-<lb/>sity Hospital (Figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>). Fifteen patients were excluded<lb/> for the following reasons: nine with a second opinion<lb/> at our hospital; four referred but returned to the origi-<lb/>nal hospital without any treatment; one with recurrent<lb/> PCC primarily treated at a different hospital; and one<lb/> who was referred for radiotherapy and continued treat-<lb/>ment at the original hospital. Of the 104 patients ana-<lb/>lyzed, 48 underwent surgical resection. Of the 56 unre-<lb/>sectable patients, 44 underwent chemotherapy. Patient<lb/> baseline characteristics are shown (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).There were<lb/> 68 male and 36 female patients. The median age was 71<lb/> years. Compared with surgically treated patients, unre-<lb/>sectable patients had a shorter follow-up period with a<lb/> median of 406 days (vs. 632 days), an advanced clinical<lb/> stage, advanced tumor factor, advanced metastasis fac-<lb/>tor, more prediagnostic cholangitis, a longer diagnostic<lb/> period, more frequent ERCP/percutaneous transhepatic<lb/> biliary drainage (PTBD) sessions within the diagnostic<lb/> period, and more drainage-related cholangitis (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Prognostic factors for all 104 PCC patients<lb/></head>

			<p>The median survival time (MST) of the 104 PCC<lb/> patients was 599 days (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). Univariate analy-<lb/>sis indicated that the factors associated with OS in<lb/> all 104 PCC patients were surgical resection, Bis-<lb/>muth type, endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), drainage-<lb/>related cholangitis, and total bilirubin level (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).<lb/> In the multivariate analysis of these factors, surgical<lb/> resection, Bismuth type, and drainage-related cholangi-<lb/>tis were significant factors associated with OS (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).<lb/> Drainage-related cholangitis shortened OS, while surgi-<lb/>cal resection and Bismuth type I/II/IIIb improved survival<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">1b-d</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Surgically treated patients and prognostic<lb/> factors<lb/></head>

			<p>The MST of the 48 patients who underwent surgery<lb/> was 893 days (Figures <ref type="figure">1c and 2a</ref>). Univariate analy-<lb/>sis indicated that the factors associated with OS were<lb/></p>

			<p>drainage-related cholangitis and endoscopic nasobil-<lb/>iary drainage (ENBD) as the first drainage (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the multivariate analysis, drainage-related cholangi-<lb/>tis was the only prognostic factor (HR 4.69, p = 0.003,<lb/> Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The MSTs of the drainage-related cholan-<lb/>gitis group and no cholangitis group were 607 and<lb/> 1460 days, respectively (p = 0.0005, Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). The<lb/> risk factors for drainage-related cholangitis in the sur-<lb/>gically treated patients were analyzed with a logis-<lb/>tic regression model. Univariate analysis showed EST,<lb/> ENBD as the first drainage, and four or more ERCP<lb/> sessions/PTBDs within the diagnostic period as factors<lb/> related to drainage-related cholangitis. In the multivari-<lb/>ate analysis, EST (odds ratio [OR] 5.97, p = 0.042),<lb/> ENBD as first drainage (OR 0.17, p = 0.047), and four or<lb/> more ERCP/PTBD sessions within the diagnostic period<lb/> (OR 36.30, p = 0.007) were independent factors of<lb/> drainage-related cholangitis (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Regarding the operative findings, no difference was<lb/> observed between the drainage-related cholangitis<lb/> group and the no cholangitis group with respect to R0<lb/> resection, preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy,<lb/> lymphatic vessel invasion, vascular invasion, and neural<lb/> invasion (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). The percentage of overall recurrence<lb/> did not differ between the drainage-related cholangitis<lb/> group and the no cholangitis group. Changes in patho-<lb/>logical lymph node metastasis were the only pathologi-<lb/>cal factor related to prognosis observed in the drainage-<lb/>related cholangitis group compared with the no cholan-<lb/>gitis group (Table <ref type="table">5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>ERCP plays an important role in patients with sus-<lb/>pected PCC. Our study focuses on the period of pri-<lb/>mary drainage and diagnosis of suspected PCCs and<lb/> defines this time as the diagnostic period. During this<lb/> period, we often experience a delay in treatment due to<lb/> difficulties associated with biliary drainage and unclear<lb/> histopathological diagnosis. Multiple sessions of ERCP<lb/> frequently cause drainage-related cholangitis, resulting<lb/> in re-drainage. If drainage-related cholangitis can be<lb/></p>

			<p>avoided, biliary drainage must have a stronger positive<lb/> influence on the prognosis of PCC patients. Indeed, in<lb/> our study, drainage-related cholangitis was a prognos-<lb/>tic factor associated with OS in preoperative patients<lb/> and seemed to be the main prognostic factor within the<lb/> diagnostic period. However, drainage-related cholangitis<lb/> did not affect OS in unresectable and chemotherapy-<lb/>treated patients. Most patients with chemotherapy suf-<lb/>fer from repeated cholangitis in the overall treatment<lb/> period, resulting in a decrease in the direct impact of<lb/> drainage-related cholangitis within the initial diagnos-<lb/>tic period. No endoscopic prognostic factor within the<lb/> diagnostic period could be detected in chemotherapy-<lb/>treated patients in our study, and from this point of view,<lb/> the diagnostic period is of stronger importance in surgi-<lb/>cally treated patients than in unresectable patients.<lb/></p>

			<p>We have shown that EST, multiple drainages within<lb/> the diagnostic period, and ENBD as the first drainage<lb/> were factors associated with drainage-related cholan-<lb/>gitis in surgically treated patients. EST, the first fac-<lb/>tor detected in our study, and cholangitis are closely<lb/> related. In patients with common bile duct stones, EST<lb/> has been reported to cause acute cholangitis in 31%<lb/> and liver abscess in 11% of patients. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> In this previ-<lb/>ous report, all cholangitis patients had residual intra-<lb/>hepatic stones, similar to cholangiocarcinoma in that<lb/> cholestasis occurs in the intrahepatic ducts. EST did<lb/> not decrease the frequency of post-ERCP pancreati-<lb/>tis in PCC patients in our study (data not shown), and<lb/> considering these results, EST without any specific rea-<lb/>son must be avoided in the diagnostic period for sus-<lb/>pected PCC patients. In our study, multiple drainage<lb/> events within the diagnostic period were the second risk<lb/> factor for drainage-related cholangitis. ERCP itself and<lb/> biliary stenting are known risk factors for cholangitis. <ref type="biblio">6,17<lb/></ref> Multiple ERCP sessions provide multiple opportunities<lb/></p>

			<p>for enteral bacteria to enter the bile duct, which may<lb/> increase the risk of cholangitis. The pre-ERCP strategy<lb/> of diagnosis and appropriate biliary drainage is impor-<lb/>tant in reducing the risk of drainage-related cholangi-<lb/>tis. Next, ENBD as the first drainage was the third and<lb/> only protective factor against drainage-related cholangi-<lb/>tis. The drainage method that is most beneficial to PCC<lb/> patients has always been a question. ENBD is superior<lb/> to endoscopic biliary stenting (EBS) in reducing the risk<lb/> of obstructive cholangitis and stent dysfunction. <ref type="biblio">18,19</ref> A<lb/> previous study reported that the incidence of stent dys-<lb/>function 30 days after the initial drainage was 30% in the<lb/> plastic stent group and 8% in the ENBD group. <ref type="biblio">19</ref> From<lb/> our data, ENBD within the drainage period did not affect<lb/> the mortality of all PCC patients (data not shown). How-<lb/>ever, we have shown that successful first drainage with<lb/> ENBD reduced the risk of drainage-related cholangitis<lb/> in surgically treated PCC patients. In our institute, ENBD<lb/> is the first choice for primary drainage in suspected PCC<lb/> patients given the advantages of ENBD over EBS, such<lb/> as repetitive bile cytology and cholangiography. After<lb/> diagnosing the extent of biliary invasion and confirming<lb/> which segment of the liver needs drainage to maintain<lb/> liver function, we deploy mostly plastic inside stents in<lb/> place of ENBD. ENBD as the first drainage method may<lb/> benefit prediagnosed PCC patients with resectability.<lb/> We investigated why drainage-related segmental<lb/> cholangitis is associated with worse survival in surgi-<lb/>cally treated patients. When we compared the drainage-<lb/>related cholangitis group with the no cholangitis group,<lb/> more pathological lymph node metastasis was observed<lb/> in the cholangitis group.Pathological lymph node metas-<lb/></p>

			<p>tasis is one of the strongest prognostic factors for PCC.<lb/></p>

			<p>The 5-year survival rate associated with PCC with pN1<lb/> is 20%, while that of PCC with pN0 is 80%. <ref type="biblio">20</ref> Inap-<lb/>propriate cholangiography of the undrained areas may<lb/> trigger drainage-related cholangitis in these areas. The<lb/> increase in intrabiliary pressure and vascular permeabil-<lb/>ity due to segmental cholangitis in areas with PCC may<lb/> promote local lymph node metastasis. As in many can-<lb/>cers, inflammation of the bile duct and carcinogenesis in<lb/> cholangiocarcinoma are closely related. The known risk<lb/> factors for cholangiocarcinoma are primary sclerosing<lb/> cholangitis and intrahepatic biliary stones, which both<lb/> involve chronic inflammation via cholestasis. Inflamma-<lb/>tion is reported to enhance the metastatic abilities of<lb/> cancer cells by maintaining cancer stem cells. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> The<lb/> proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a triggers endothelial<lb/> mesenchymal transition in cholangiocarcinoma, promot-<lb/>ing a tendency toward metastasis. <ref type="biblio">22</ref> These basic data<lb/> support the possibility that inflammation may shorten<lb/> the OS of PCC patients by promoting lymph node<lb/> metastasis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our study has limitations. First, our study is a single-<lb/>center retrospective study. A multicenter randomized<lb/> study is required to show whether the identified factors,<lb/> such as EST, are associated with worse survival via an<lb/> increase in drainage-related cholangitis. We also could<lb/> not collect adequate information to identify the details<lb/> of drainage-related cholangitis because our study was<lb/> retrospective. Therefore, important factors of drainage-<lb/>related cholangitis, including whether drainage-related<lb/> cholangitis occurred in drained or undrained areas and<lb/> the reasons for drainage-related cholangitis like inap-<lb/>propriate biliary drainage and stent dysfunction, could<lb/> not be assessed. Second, our survival curve was gener-<lb/>ated using patient data within 5 years of surgical resec-<lb/>tion, making our survival data inaccurate. Therefore, we<lb/> could not analyze recurrence-free survival, an impor-<lb/>tant factor in postoperative survival. Third, our stenting<lb/> methods and types of stents used were not consistent<lb/> during the study period. For this reason, we could not<lb/> clarify which type of biliary stenting affects prognosis,<lb/> even though biliary stenting is a major factor in biliary<lb/> drainage in PCC.<lb/></p>

			<p>Here, we found that drainage-related cholangitis<lb/> was a prognostic factor for surgically treated patients,<lb/> and EST, multiple ERCP sessions, and ENBD as the<lb/> first drainage were factors related to drainage-related<lb/> cholangitis. PCC requires a multiple biliary approach<lb/> to clarify the possibility of surgical resection and sus-<lb/>tain effective drainage. During the diagnostic period, we<lb/> must consider that all patients without obvious distant<lb/> metastasis are candidates for R0 resection. Avoiding<lb/> drainage-related cholangitis within the diagnostic period<lb/> may improve the survival of PCC patients.<lb/></p>
