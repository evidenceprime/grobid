	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) are a major public health problem in developing countries including<lb/> those in the Middle East. However, to date, there is a paucity of information related to physician-diagnosed AR in this region. The Allergies in Middle East<lb/> Survey was undertaken to help clarify and broaden the understanding of physician-diagnosed AR across Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United<lb/> Arab Emirates. The survey explores the frequency of physician-diagnosed AR, prevalence and types of associated symptoms, the impact on quality of life (QOL),<lb/> current treatment practices, and therapy expectations.<lb/> Methods: In total, 7411 households in five countries (Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates) were screened to identify<lb/> individuals that were Ն4 years old with a physician diagnosis of AR and either symptoms and/or treatment in the past 12 months. A total of 501 respondents<lb/> from the five countries completed the survey. Standardized questionnaires were used to make comparisons across the regions; however, the data collection<lb/> procedures were tailored for each country. The sample was probability based to ensure valid statistical inference to the population.<lb/> Results: Ten percent of the Middle East population surveyed had a physician diagnosis of AR, with 65% of respondents stating that their allergies were<lb/> intermittent in nature. An otolaryngologist or allergist diagnosed the majority of the individuals surveyed. Runny nose, nasal and throat itching, postnasal<lb/> drip, and nasal congestion or stuffed up nose were the most common and bothersome symptoms of AR. The majority of survey participants (58% of the overall<lb/> survey population) with AR reported that the condition had an impact on their daily private and professional life. Seventy-two percent of adults reported that<lb/> their AR symptoms limited their work/school activities and 35% reported that their AR interfered with and caused them to miss work or school within the<lb/> past 12 months. One factor, in addition to the outward AR symptoms, that could have contributed to these function impairments may have been sleep<lb/> disturbances. Although a secondary symptom to AR, sleep disturbances (difficulty getting to sleep, waking up during the night or lack of a good night&apos;s sleep)<lb/> were shown in this survey to be extremely troubling in ϳ15% of AR sufferers. In the past year Ͼ90% of patients reported taking a medication of any type<lb/> for their AR, with nearly a 4:1 ratio of patients taking a prescription medication versus an over-the-counter (OTC) medication in the past 4 weeks. Over 75%<lb/> of survey respondents reported taking an intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) in the last 4 weeks and the satisfaction rate of INCS medications was similar to that<lb/> reported for OTC medications. The most common reasons cited for dissatisfaction with INCS medications were inadequate effectiveness, bothersome side effects<lb/> (e.g., unpleasant taste and retrograde drainage into the pharynx), decreased effectiveness with chronic use, and failure to provide 24-hour relief.<lb/> Conclusion: These data show that AR is common in the Middle East region as elsewhere in the world. Many patients with AR in Middle East region suffer<lb/> from their symptoms (e.g., runny nose, nasal itching, nasal congestion, postnasal drip, and other symptoms) on all or most days during the times of the year<lb/> that their allergies are worst. These symptoms have been shown to reduce QOL and performance at work/school to a significant degree. Additionally, the survey<lb/> data underscore a considerable treatment gap with current therapies for AR and that many AR patients still have not found adequate effectiveness with<lb/> currently available medications. Thus, through identification of disease impact on the Middle East population and highlighting treatment gaps, clinicians in<lb/> the Middle East may better understand and treat AR, leading to improvements in overall patient satisfaction and QOL.<lb/></div>
