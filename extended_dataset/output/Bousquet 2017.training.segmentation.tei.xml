			<body>Edited by: Thomas Bieber <lb/>K E Y W O R D S <lb/>Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma, EuroQuol, MACVIA-ARIA Sentinel NetworK, rhinitis, <lb/>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment in allergy <lb/>1 | INTRODUCTION <lb/>Measures of allergic rhinitis (AR) control include symptom scores, <lb/>patients&apos; self-administered visual analogue scales (VAS), objective <lb/>measures of nasal obstruction, a recent modification of the ARIA <lb/>severity classification, or patients&apos; reported outcomes such as QOL <lb/>and scores with several items. 1,2 Mobile technology has been used <lb/>to appraise AR control. 3,4 More information is, however, needed to <lb/>fully understand the importance of these novel approaches. <lb/>MASK-rhinitis (MACVIA-ARIA Sentinel NetworK for allergic rhini-<lb/>tis), an ICT system centred around the patient, 5 is one of the imple-<lb/>mentation tools of the B3 Action Plan of the European Innovation <lb/>Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP on AHA). 6 A mobile <lb/>phone app (Allergy Diary) central to MASK-rhinitis belongs to the <lb/>Fondation Partenariale FMC VIA-LR (Ministry of Education and <lb/>Research, France). App users are asked to complete a short demo-<lb/>graphic questionnaire, EQ-5D 7-10 and WPAI-AS, 11,12 thus providing <lb/>baseline characteristics of their disease. The Allergy Diary has been <lb/>launched in 21 countries. 3,4 It was found to be an easy and effective <lb/>method of assessing symptoms of AR and work productivity. The <lb/>ARIA score is also available in the Allergy Diary, adding the four <lb/>components of the impact of AR (sleep, work and school perfor-<lb/>mance, daily activities and bothersome symptoms). <lb/>The ARIA score of the Allergy Diary was compared with QOL <lb/>scores of EQ-5D 7-10 and WPAI-AS. 11,12 <lb/>2 | ME TH ODS <lb/>2.1 | Design of the study <lb/>A cross-sectional study on a self-selected population was carried out <lb/>from 1 June 2016 to 1 June 2017. EQ-5D 7-10 and/or WPAI-AS 11,12 <lb/>questionnaires are only available in some countries, and not all of <lb/>the Allergy Diary users filled in these questionnaires as they are <lb/>optional. All users filled in the ARIA score. The ARIA score was com-<lb/>pared with the EQ-5D VAS and Question 9 (degree allergy affected <lb/>regular activities) of the WPAI-AS. <lb/>The study is reported according to STROBE. <lb/>2.2 | Setting and users <lb/>All consecutive users from 1 June 2016 to 1 June 2017 who <lb/>answered the questions of the EQ-5D 7-10 and/or WPAI-AS 11,12 were <lb/>included in the study in 18 countries. Some demographic characteris-<lb/>tics (age, sex, country and language) were recorded. The App was <lb/>used by people who found it on Internet, Apple App store, Google <lb/>Play store or in any other way. A few users were clinic patients that <lb/>were asked by their physicians to use the app. However, due to <lb/>anonymization of data, no specific information was gathered. <lb/>2.3 | Allergy diary <lb/>The app collects information on AR symptoms experienced (nasal and <lb/>ocular), disease type (intermittent/persistent), how symptoms impact <lb/>users&apos; lives, and type(s) of AR treatment used (Table S1). The system <lb/>has been deployed in 21 countries and in 16 languages (translated and <lb/>back-translated, culturally adapted and legally compliant). <lb/>2.4 | Ethics <lb/>The Allergy Diary is CE1 registered but not considered by the Ethical <lb/>Committee of the Cologne hospital of the MHRA (Medicines and <lb/>Healthcare products Regulatory Agency-GOV.UK) as a medical <lb/>device as it does not provide recommendations concerning treat-<lb/>ment or diagnosis. The terms of use, translated into all languages <lb/>and customized according to each country&apos;s legislation, allow the use <lb/>of the results for research purposes. The data are anonymized <lb/>except for geolocalized data that are never totally anonymous. An <lb/>Independent Review Board approval was not needed. <lb/>2.5 | Outcomes <lb/>The ARIA score was calculated using the four Q4 questions of the <lb/>Allergy Diary which include impact on daily activities, work and sleep <lb/>as well as troublesome symptoms (Table S1). Each of the four items <lb/>was ascribed a score of 1 (&quot;Yes&quot;) or 0 (&quot;No&quot;). The total ARIA score <lb/>ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 4 (severe impairment). <lb/>The electronic form of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (https://euro <lb/>qol.org) was applied in the 10 available languages (Danish, Dutch, Eng-<lb/>lish, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish) (Data <lb/>S1). We assessed the global VAS level and mobility impairment as this <lb/>was an absent domain in the assessment of AR impairment. <lb/>The electronic form of the WPAI-AS questionnaire was applied <lb/>in the 10 available languages (same as above for EQ-5D) 11,12 accord-<lb/>ing to the package obtained from Reilly and associates (www.reillyas <lb/>sociates.net/WPAI_General.html). The percentage of impairment due <lb/>to allergy for daily activities (Q9) was the outcome used. (Data S2). <lb/>2.6 | Classification of users <lb/>Users with any positive answer to Q4 (Table S1) were classified as <lb/>&quot;rhinitis&quot; (score 0-4). Those with a score of zero were classified as <lb/>&quot;no rhinitis&quot; if they had no symptom (Q3, Table S1). Those with a <lb/>positive answer were classified as &quot;rhinitis&quot; (score 0). <lb/>BOUSQUET ET AL. <lb/>| 507 <lb/>2.7 | Statistical methods and analyses <lb/>Some users filled in EQ-5D or WPAI-AS more than once for a single <lb/>day, in which case the first data were used. A non-Gaussian distribu-<lb/>tion was found for some of the data (Shapiro-Wilk test). However, <lb/>EQ-5D data are usually reported in means and SD. Since the number <lb/>of observations was large, we used parametric analyses. <lb/>3 | RESULTS <lb/>3.1 | Users <lb/>Of the 12 179 registered users, 1287 filled in the EQ-5D question-<lb/>naire and 1028 the WPAI-AS questionnaire (Table S2). Among the <lb/>843 users who filled in both questionnaires, there were 507 women <lb/>(60%) and 336 men (40%), with a mean (AESD) age of 35 AE 14 years. <lb/>3.2 | Main results <lb/>Similar levels of EQ-5D VAS and WPAI-AS Q9 were found for users <lb/>with no rhinitis and for those with an ARIA score of 0-2. There was <lb/>a significant reduction in EQ-5D VAS levels and a significant increase <lb/>in WPAI-AS Q9 levels in users with an ARIA score of 3 or 4 <lb/>(Table 1). <lb/>The repartition of users for both EQ-5D and WPAI-AS (Figure 1) <lb/>shows that impairment occurred significantly more commonly for <lb/>ARIA scores of 3 and 4 than for ARIA scores of 0-3. There were <lb/>from 12% to 16% of users with an EQ-5D VAS level ≥60 in ARIA <lb/>scores 0-2 whereas the level increased to 26% and 27% in users <lb/>with an ARIA score of 3 or 4. There were from 19% to 31% of users <lb/>with a Q9 ≥50 in ARIA scores of 0-2 whereas the level increased to <lb/>51% and 53% in users with a score of 3 or 4. <lb/>4 | DISCUSSION <lb/>This pilot study using mobile technology showed that QOL data <lb/>(EQ-5D VAS and WPAI-AS Q9) are similar in users without rhinitis <lb/>as in those with mild rhinitis (scores 0-2). Users with a score of 3 or <lb/>4 had a significant impairment in QOL. <lb/>4.1 | Strengths and limitations <lb/>The strengths and limitations of this study are those of mobile <lb/>technology lengthily discussed previously. 3,4 In particular, there is a <lb/>lack of patient characterization that is impossible using an App. <lb/>However, every observational study we have performed using the <lb/>Allergy Diary has confirmed its interest and was able to identify <lb/>users with a severe disease. It is likely that mobile technology will <lb/>become a very important tool for the understanding and manage-<lb/>ment of AR. <lb/>One specific problem of the study is that there are more coun-<lb/>tries with EQ-5D or WPAI-AS reporting than translations in the App. <lb/>It is not known which translations were employed by users. <lb/>In this study, we did not perform subanalyses assessing the <lb/>importance of symptoms or other factors. We did not investigate <lb/>the treatments received. As this is a pilot study, these analyses will <lb/>be carried out once the number of users will have increased. <lb/>T A B L E 1 Mean levels of EuroQuol (EQ-5D) and Work <lb/>Productivity and Activity Impairment in allergy (WPAI-AS) depending <lb/>on the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) score <lb/>EQ-5D VAS <lb/>WPAI-AS Q9 <lb/>N <lb/>mAE SD <lb/>N <lb/>m AE SD <lb/>No rhinitis <lb/>48 <lb/>80.0 AE 19.0 <lb/>49 <lb/>27.5 AE 25.5 <lb/>ARIA score <lb/>0 <lb/>83 <lb/>77.0 AE 21.3 a <lb/>71 <lb/>29.9 AE 27.3 d <lb/>1 <lb/>403 <lb/>79.5 AE 19.1 <lb/>308 <lb/>20.4 AE 22.1 <lb/>2 <lb/>368 <lb/>76.2 AE 20.2 <lb/>268 <lb/>30.1 AE 23.9 <lb/>3 <lb/>199 <lb/>72.6 AE 18.7 b <lb/>164 <lb/>41.4 AE 27.3 <lb/>4 <lb/>186 <lb/>67.7 AE 23.0 c <lb/>168 <lb/>45.8 AE 27.7 e <lb/>P a/b &lt; .0001, P a/c &lt; .0001, P d/e &lt; .0001, Student&apos;s t test. <lb/>ARIA score <lb/>CumulaƟve prevalence <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/>30 40 50 60 70 80 90 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>70 <lb/>80 <lb/>90 <lb/>100 <lb/>0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>EQ-5D VAS <lb/>≤ <lb/>≥ <lb/>WPAI-AS Q9 <lb/>P&lt;.0001 <lb/>P&lt;.0001 <lb/>-100 <lb/>(A) <lb/>(B) <lb/>F I G U R E 1 Repartition of users <lb/>depending on EuroQuol (EQ-5D) visual <lb/>analogue scale (A) and Work Productivity <lb/>and Activity Impairment in allergy (WPAI-<lb/>AS) Q9 (B) <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">4.2 | Generalizability <lb/>The EQ-5D scores observed in the study accord with those of previ-<lb/>ous studies. 8,10 Users with an ARIA score of 3 to 4 have a level simi-<lb/>lar to that of asthmatic patients with uncontrolled asthma. 13,14 <lb/>Because of the equal weighing score of ARIA, it is difficult to know <lb/>whether these differences may be due to specific symptoms (eg, <lb/>sleep). EQ-5D is a MAFEIP (Monitoring and assessment framework <lb/>for the EIP on AHA) tool, 15 and the present study is in line with the <lb/>EIP on AHA. This is another important finding as the Transfer of <lb/>Innovation of the Allergy Diary is an EIP on AHA scaling up pro-<lb/>ject. 16 <lb/>One of the major findings of the study is the very similar results with <lb/>both tools. This supports use of the ARIA score to assess AR control <lb/>using mobile technology. The WPAI-AS scores observed in the study are <lb/>lower than those reported in patients selected by physicians. 11,17-19 This <lb/>is because many users have mild rhinitis whereas in clinical trials or in <lb/>patients selected by physicians, AR is usually more severe. <lb/>This study also suggests that, in real life, there is a phenotype of <lb/>severe AR that needs to be considered in terms of public health and <lb/>cost savings, as the severe form causes disability. This phenotype is <lb/>in focus with the Finnish Allergy Program. 20 <lb/>CONF LICTS OF INTEREST <lb/>Dr. BOUSQUET reports personal fees and other from Chiesi, Cipla, <lb/>Hikma, Menarini, Mundipharma, Mylan, Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, <lb/>Takeda, Teva, Uriach, other from Kyomed, from null, outside the <lb/>submitted work Dr. Devillier reports personal fees from Astra-<lb/>Zeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Meda Pharma, personal fees and non-<lb/>financial support from Stallergenes, ALK-Abello, Menarini, Chiesi, <lb/>outside the submitted work Dr. Kuna reports personal fees from <lb/>Berlin Chemie Menarini, FAES, HAL, ALK, Allergopharma, Adamed, <lb/>Polpharma, outside the submitted work Dr. Mösges reports personal <lb/>fees from Allergy Therapeutics, ALK, Allergopharma, Bayer, FAES, <lb/>Friulchem, GSK, Hexal, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Klosterfrau, MSD, Meda, <lb/>Servier, Stada, UCB, Nuvo; grants from ASIT biotech, Optima, Leti, <lb/>BitopAG, Hulka, Ursapharm; grants and personal fees from Bencard, <lb/>Stallergenes; grants, personal fees and non-financial support from <lb/>Lofarma, Novartis; non-financial support from Roxall, Bionorica, <lb/>Atmos; non-financial support from Otonomy, Ferrero, outside the <lb/>submitted work.
