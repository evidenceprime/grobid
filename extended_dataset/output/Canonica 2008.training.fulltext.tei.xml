			<p>I n clinical trials of allergic rhinitis (AR), quality of life <ref type="biblio">(QoL)<lb/></ref> is assessed by questionnaires that ask subjects about the<lb/> effects of AR on various domains of their daily lives, including<lb/> practical functions, social interactions, emotional well-being,<lb/> and economic activity. These instruments comprise both ge-<lb/>neric questionnaires that measure physical, mental, and psy-<lb/>chosocial functioning, such as the Medical Outcomes Study<lb/> 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, <ref type="biblio">1,2</ref> and ones that are more<lb/> disease specific, such as the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of<lb/> Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), Rhinasthma, and the Rhinosinu-<lb/>sitis Disability Index. <ref type="biblio">3Y5</ref> The effects of AR on health-related<lb/> QoL extend to learning, sleep, vitality/alertness, perception of<lb/> general health, cognitive and emotional functioning, and psy-<lb/>chomotor performance. <ref type="biblio">6Y8</ref> Strong, highly significant correla-<lb/>tions have been found between clinical AR symptoms and<lb/> QoL. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> Such limitations on daily functioning can have negative<lb/> effects on a person&apos;s performance at home, school, or work,<lb/> which have both a direct and an indirect economic impact on<lb/> society. <ref type="biblio">9<lb/></ref> An online survey conducted in 2004 to assess QoL in<lb/> 2002 patients with AR and nasal congestion (or their care-<lb/>givers) has reinforced these findings. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> Within the subgroup<lb/> of working adults (n = 1043), 59% reported that their con-<lb/>gestion had affected their job performance. Of the 446<lb/> caregivers, 42% said that congestion led to their child&apos;s poor<lb/> productivity in school. Nasal congestion associated with AR<lb/> also led to feelings of discomfort, frustration, fatigue, irri-<lb/>tability, and stress. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> A Swedish survey of 9538 adolescents<lb/> with AR and/or asthma found that severe nasal symptoms<lb/> were associated with lower grades in school. <ref type="biblio">11<lb/></ref> Although the typical clinical symptoms of AR might<lb/> be considered relatively inconsequential, they are consistently<lb/> mentioned by patients as having a significant impact on QoL.<lb/> Thus, there may be a disconnect between clinicians&apos; percep-<lb/>tions of AR as a chronic but nonserious medical condition that<lb/> causes a limited range of symptoms and patients&apos; perceptions<lb/> of it as a limiting and disabling presence in their lives. This<lb/> disconnect may in turn lead to suboptimal treatment.<lb/></p>

			<p>To address the way health care providers and patients<lb/> perceive the effects of AR, a multinational survey, BUnder-<lb/>standing the Dynamics of Allergy Suffering and Treatment,[<lb/> conducted by the Forbes Consulting Group, was undertaken.<lb/> The objective was to better understand patients&apos; attitudes and<lb/> perceptions about the symptoms and effects of AR, treatment<lb/> approaches, and available therapies. The survey investigated<lb/> respondents&apos; product or brand choices and what form of the-<lb/>rapy they preferred (eg, tablets, nasal sprays). Some method-<lb/>ologic flexibility to define concepts was permitted within each<lb/> country.<lb/> 75 from nontreaters. The actual number of complete responses<lb/> received was 3635. Respondent panels were recruited in a way<lb/> that the geographic distribution of the panel within each coun-<lb/>try accurately reflected the population distribution.<lb/></p>

			<p>The survey was conducted by Internet, except in Spain,<lb/> where it was conducted by telephone. To ensure uniformity of<lb/> responses and to control for scale-use bias, scale variables<lb/> were standardized, setting the mean within each variable and<lb/> within each observation to zero and the SD to 1. A follow-up<lb/> interview was conducted by Internet in the United States in<lb/> November 2005.<lb/></p>

			<p>Respondents were included only if they had experienced<lb/> symptoms related to outdoor, indoor, pet, mold, or dust aller-<lb/>gies, including AR and urticaria, during the preceding<lb/> 12 months. People who primarily had food, insect, or medica-<lb/>tion allergies were excluded.<lb/></p>

			<p>Survey participants answered questions on the fre-<lb/>quency and duration of symptoms, the times of day and the<lb/> season(s) in which they occurred, and what types of symp-<lb/>toms they experienced. They were given a list of the core<lb/> allergy symptoms and were asked to note which ones they<lb/> had: sneezing, itchy/watery eyes, nasal congestion, runny<lb/> nose, sinus congestion, postnasal drip, sinus pressure, itchy<lb/> throat, sinus pain, and hives/rash. Patients were also asked to<lb/> use a list of 9 possible responses to rate the emotional impact<lb/> of their morning allergy symptoms: more irritable, more<lb/> fatigued, less motivated, less energetic, hard to concentrate,<lb/> more frustrated, less alert, more self-conscious, and feelings<lb/> not affected. There were questions about how disruptive nasal<lb/> allergies in general (and congestion specifically) were to<lb/> various aspects of everyday life, including sleep, participation<lb/> in social and outdoor activities, and mood. Data were weight-<lb/>ed to age, sex, and household income distributions. Respon-<lb/>dents in the United States were subdivided according to 3<lb/> levels of symptom severity (mild, moderate, and severe).<lb/></p>

			<p>Lifestyle impact was calculated with index scores based<lb/> on symptoms and lifestyle disruption. The prevalence of spe-<lb/>cific symptoms was multiplied by symptom severity and was<lb/> indexed against the overall average to create individual index<lb/> scores for the various symptoms. Prevalence of lifestyle dif-<lb/>ficulties was multiplied by disruptiveness and was indexed<lb/> against the overall average to create individual scores.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/> Demographics<lb/></head>

			<p>Respondent demographics are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The<lb/> percentage of male patients was similar in the 6 countries, but<lb/> the survey participants&apos; ages and overall health varied among<lb/> the countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Incidence<lb/></head>

			<p>There was considerable intercountry variability with<lb/> regard to the seasons in which AR was experienced. Forty-<lb/>four percent of respondents in the United States experienced<lb/> 3-or 4-season allergies, followed by France (35%), Germany<lb/> (33%), and the United Kingdom (30%), with much lower in-<lb/>cidences reported in Italy (16%) and Spain (11%) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In most countries, the highest percentage of<lb/> respondents experienced allergy symptoms in the spring, led<lb/> by France (92%). The only exception was in the United<lb/> Kingdom, where the highest percentage (89%) reported al-<lb/>lergies during the summer (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Respondents in the United States reported having the<lb/> greatest number of days experiencing allergy symptoms per<lb/> year (102), followed by the United Kingdom (79), Germany<lb/> (68), France (62), Italy (37), and Spain (33). Survey parti-<lb/>cipants in the United Kingdom reported the highest number of<lb/> annual days with indoor allergies (160), followed by the<lb/> United States (129), Germany (103), France (67), Italy (59),<lb/> and Spain (36).<lb/></p>

			<p>The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma Work-<lb/>shop recommended that the terms seasonal and perennial AR<lb/> be replaced with intermittent AR (IAR) and persistent AR<lb/> (PER). Intermittent AR is defined as the presence of rhinitis<lb/> symptoms for less than 4 days/wk or for less than 4 weeks,<lb/> whereas in PER, rhinitis symptoms are present for greater than<lb/> 4 days/wk and for greater than 4 weeks. <ref type="biblio">12</ref> Table <ref type="table">2</ref> lists the<lb/> distribution of patients with IAR and PER in the 6 study<lb/> countries. Spain had the most patients with IAR (70%),<lb/> whereas both the United Kingdom and the United States had<lb/> the greatest percentage of respondents with PER (53% and<lb/> 52%, respectively). This is consistent with the number of<lb/> reported symptom days.<lb/></p>

			<head>Diagnosis<lb/></head>

			<p>Respondents&apos; rhinitis was largely self-diagnosed in all<lb/> countries surveyed, led by France (74%), followed by the<lb/> United States (72%), Germany (62%), the United Kingdom<lb/> (61%), Italy (60%), and Spain (50%). Spain reported the<lb/> highest percentage of physician diagnoses (46%), followed by<lb/> Italy (41%); only in France did less than one third of res-<lb/>pondents receive a physician diagnosis. The percentage of<lb/> respondents who were diagnosed by a friend or a family<lb/> member varied from 7% in Italy and Spain to 18% in the<lb/> United Kingdom and France. A negligible percentage was<lb/> diagnosed by other means; that is, pharmacist, homeopath,<lb/> physician&apos;s assistant, nurse practitioner, or information ob-<lb/>tained in a physician&apos;s office or from an advertisement. (Res-<lb/>pondents could provide more than 1 answer to this question.)<lb/></p>

			<head>Symptoms<lb/></head>

			<p>A majority of respondents in all countries reported<lb/> sneezing and itchy/watery eyes to be their most common<lb/> symptoms (sneezing: 64%Y84%; itchy/watery eyes:<lb/> 63%Y86%). Other symptoms elicited more varied responses.<lb/> For example, 66% of respondents in the United States reported<lb/> sinus congestion compared with only 12% of those in Spain<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>There was a great amount of intercountry variability<lb/> between the number of participants reporting nasal and sinus<lb/> congestion and sinus pressure and pain. Nasal congestion was<lb/> by far the most common symptom across countries. The<lb/> percentage of positive responses to nasal congestion ranged<lb/> from 43% in France to 68% in the United States.<lb/></p>

			<p>Patients in all countries reported that their most severe<lb/> symptoms occurred Bwhen I first wake up in the morning[ or<lb/> Bat other times in the morning.[ Fifty-eight percent of res-<lb/>pondents in Spain and Italy identified the morning hours as the<lb/> time they experienced their worst allergic symptoms, followed<lb/> by France (51%), Germany (48%), and the United Kingdom<lb/> and the United States (both 46%). Lesser percentages were<lb/> noted for severe afternoon, evening, and nighttime allergies<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>FIGURE 2. Time of year when allergy symptoms were experienced.<lb/></figure>

			<figure type="table">TABLE 2. Distribution of IAR and PER<lb/> AR Type France Germany<lb/> Italy<lb/> Spain<lb/> United<lb/> Kingdom<lb/> United<lb/> States<lb/> IAR, %<lb/> 50<lb/> 52<lb/> 64<lb/> 70<lb/> 47<lb/> 48<lb/> PER, %<lb/> 50<lb/> 48<lb/> 36<lb/> 30<lb/> 53<lb/> 52<lb/></figure>

			<p>However, the nature of morning symptoms varied. Res-<lb/>pondents in France and Spain identified sneezing as their most<lb/> frequent symptom upon rising (60%), whereas in the United<lb/> States it was nasal congestion (56%). More than half of<lb/> Spanish respondents experienced itchy eyes and runny nose<lb/> most frequently in the morning; Spain was the only country<lb/> that reported a 50% or greater response rate for both of these<lb/> symptoms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Overall, US participants reported more negative emo-<lb/>tional effects from morning allergies than those surveyed in<lb/> the other 5 countries. In general, irritability and fatigue were<lb/> the most common effects of symptoms, with some variation<lb/> between the countries. Responders in Italy reported a higher<lb/> degree of irritability (58%), followed by the United States<lb/> (55%) and the United Kingdom (53%), compared with only<lb/> 24% of responders in Spain. French participants noted the<lb/> highest degree of fatigue (59%), followed by the United States<lb/> (52%); it was identified as a primary morning concern by 31%<lb/> to 44% of patients in the other countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>A large percentage of responders reported difficulty in<lb/> falling asleep without trouble, ranging from 47% in Spain to<lb/> 26% in Germany and the United Kingdom. When respon-<lb/>dents were asked whether this problem was disruptive, 73% in<lb/> the United States, 71% in France, 68% in Germany, 57% in the<lb/> United Kingdom, and 52% in Italy said that it was; however,<lb/> only 24% of those in Spain (many of whom had reported<lb/> difficulty in falling asleep) said that it was disruptive (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>From a list of 12 topics on the impact of AR on lifestyle,<lb/> breathing normally was ranked as the first and most common<lb/> difficulty across all countries (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The topic ranked last<lb/> in all countries was the impact on the ability to take care of<lb/> children. Overall, issues relating to sleep and rest were rated as<lb/></p>

			<figure>FIGURE 3. Allergy symptoms experienced.<lb/> FIGURE 4. Time of day when symptoms were most severe.<lb/> WAO Journal &amp; September 2008<lb/> Patient perceptions of AR and QoL<lb/> * 2008 World Allergy Organization<lb/></figure>

			<p>more difficult than issues relating to social interaction. There<lb/> was considerable divergence about the ability to participate in<lb/> outdoor activities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Treatment Regimens<lb/></head>

			<p>Despite the large rate of reported self-diagnoses, in all<lb/> countries the highest response to the question BWhy did you<lb/> first try the product you use most often?[ was BDoctor<lb/> recommended/prescribed it.[ This was true for both prescrip-<lb/>tion (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments, with the<lb/> highest percentage of drug choices based on physician<lb/> recommendation occurring in Spain (86% Rx; 76% OTC).<lb/> Spain (66%) and France (62%) had the highest rates of Rx<lb/> drug use, and the United Kingdom had the highest rate of OTC<lb/> drug use (41%).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the United Kingdom, 23% of responders selected<lb/> their own medications regardless of physician input, and 28%<lb/> of those in this subgroup chose OTC formulations. Friends<lb/> and pharmacists were also identified as major influences in the<lb/> selection of OTC formulations, but they had a considerably<lb/> smaller influence on Rx drug choice. Advertising had some<lb/> influence when it came to patient choice of OTC medications<lb/> but was much less influential in Rx drug choice.<lb/></p>

			<p>When questioned about their preferred form of allergy<lb/> medication (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>), most respondents in the 5 European<lb/> countries reported that they had tried tablets/pills/caplets, and<lb/> of that group, a majority expressed preference for this form. In<lb/> France, for example, 77% had taken tablets and 54% preferred<lb/> them, followed by the United Kingdom with 75% reporting<lb/> use and 53% expressing preference. Both German and Italian<lb/> responders had used nasal sprays in larger percentages than<lb/> tablets (71% and 52%, respectively), but neither group pre-<lb/>ferred nasal sprays to tablets. Twenty to 48% of respondents<lb/> across countries also reported having tried eye drops. Much<lb/> smaller percentages of responders had tried other vehicles of<lb/> administration (eg, syrups, throat spray, liquid gels).<lb/></p>

			<p>Respondents from the 5 European countries answered<lb/> questions designed to identify which brands (both prescription<lb/> and OTC) they had used and which ones they had heard of and<lb/> were likely to try in the future. As a rule in all countries, the<lb/> brand that received the highest percentage of positive<lb/> responses tended to achieve the highest degree of preference<lb/> for current and future use.<lb/></p>

			<p>Attributes listed by respondents of the ideal drug to treat<lb/> allergies were fairly consistent across all countries. Efficacy,<lb/> rapid onset of action, safety, and lack of side effects were rated<lb/> as the most important attributes. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> lists other desirable<lb/> qualities identified by 80% or greater of allergy sufferers from<lb/> the individual countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ideal attributes of allergy medications change over time.<lb/> In US respondents, attributes that became more significant<lb/> were relief of symptoms, recommendation by physicians and<lb/> pharmacists, freedom from sedating qualities and other<lb/> adverse effects, and not interfering with a good night&apos;s sleep.<lb/> Some remained unchanged, such as efficacy and safety, and<lb/> others became less significant, including taste, reputation, and<lb/> use by the whole family.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although there are many treatment options for AR, it<lb/> remains a largely undertreated condition. The percentage of<lb/> nontreaters in this survey ranged from 11% in the United<lb/> States to 21% in Germany. Reasons that respondents in this<lb/> subgroup did not treat their AR included the following:<lb/> delaying time to seek treatment because they believed that<lb/> their symptoms were unimportant, finding the cost of<lb/> medications too high, or having an inadequate relationship<lb/> with their physician or health care provider. <ref type="biblio">13</ref> Improving<lb/> communication between clinicians and patients can lead to<lb/> greater use of therapeutic interventions that will aid in<lb/> symptom relief. <ref type="biblio">13<lb/></ref></p>

 DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>The information gathered from allergy sufferers through<lb/> the present survey supports the observations of many<lb/> clinicians that people with AR perceive their symptoms as<lb/> causing significant QoL disruptions. Allergic rhinitis has an<lb/> unquestionable impact on QoL, including limitations on daily<lb/> activity and decreased productivity at work and school.<lb/></p>

			<p>The information provided by QoL questionnaires<lb/> focusing on AR has also made it clear that patients with AR<lb/> are impaired in many domains of their daily lives. <ref type="biblio">13</ref> Symptoms<lb/> of AR are generally most prevalent in the morning, leading to<lb/> problems throughout the day. In 2005, Long conducted a<lb/> survey of 1000 adults with AR; 65% had symptoms upon<lb/> awakening and 83% of respondents had symptoms throughout<lb/> the morning. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> Forty-nine percent of those surveyed said that<lb/> their AR was at its worst in the morning. In the subgroup of<lb/> those who experienced symptoms on awakening, 80% felt less<lb/> energetic, 77% more fatigued, 75% less motivated, and 74%<lb/> more irritable than usual. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> In the present survey, participants<lb/> reported that all symptoms were most severe when they first<lb/> woke up in the morning or during other times in the morning.<lb/></p>

			<p>Respondents in all countries said they had experienced<lb/> difficulty in falling asleep. Sleep disturbances are commonly<lb/> noted in patients with AR and contribute to a reduction in<lb/> QoL. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> One survey involving nearly 5000 subjects with AR<lb/> found that those who frequently had symptoms at night were<lb/> significantly more likely to report habitual snoring, chronic<lb/> excessive daytime sleepiness, or chronic nonrestorative sleep<lb/> (P G 0.0001). <ref type="biblio">16</ref> A smaller study comparing subjects with<lb/></p>

			<p>seasonal AR (SAR) with healthy volunteers found a<lb/> statistically significant relation between nighttime sleep<lb/> disruption and daytime sleepiness in those with SAR (P =<lb/> 0.048). However, the daytime sleepiness could be related to<lb/> the SAR symptoms as well as the impaired sleep. <ref type="biblio">17<lb/></ref> A recent 2-week study of 483 subjects with AR<lb/> randomized to desloratadine 5 mg or placebo found that<lb/> treatment with the second-generation antihistamine deslorata-<lb/>dine significantly improved total RQLQ scores between<lb/> baseline and day 14 (P = 0.0003 vs placebo). Significant<lb/> decreases in RQLQ subdomain scores were also seen with<lb/> desloratadine. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> In another 2-week study of subjects with SAR<lb/> (N = 688), fexofenadine 120 mg therapy led to significant<lb/> improvements in overall QoL, as measured by the RQLQ (P e<lb/> 0.005 vs placebo). <ref type="biblio">19<lb/></ref> Given the pervasive adverse effects of AR on function<lb/> and capacity, it is evident that medical treatment for AR should<lb/> address issues beyond clinical outcome measures. One of the<lb/> chief goals of therapy is to improve patients&apos; well-being and<lb/> their ability to function. Treatment modalities should not only<lb/> provide optimum clinical benefits; they should also increase<lb/> patient satisfaction. <ref type="biblio">20,21</ref> The allergy treatment outcome that<lb/> survey respondents in all countries desired most was the<lb/> ability to breathe normally; getting restorative sleep was<lb/> ranked second and feeling well rested during the day third.<lb/> Attributes of the ideal AR medication identified by respon-<lb/>dents in most countries included rapid onset of action, safety,<lb/> and minimal bothersome side effects.<lb/></p>

			<p>Responses to the survey suggest that AR is often<lb/> perceived as causing daytime fatigue. It is possible that some<lb/> people with AR could be experiencing the sedating effects of<lb/> first-generation antihistamines in addition to the impairment<lb/> and sleep disturbances caused by their symptoms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although not specifically addressed by the survey<lb/> administrators, it should be noted that there are differences<lb/> among the 5 European countries in allergenic pollens. Grass,<lb/> birch, mugwort, and ragweed pollen predominate in central<lb/> Europe and in mountainous areas, whereas olive, cypress, and<lb/> plants in the genus Parietaria dominate in the Mediterranean<lb/> region. <ref type="biblio">22</ref> Although pollen seasons tend to be shorter in<lb/> northern climates with colder weather, allergy severity varies<lb/> from year to year depending on weather patterns, especially<lb/> rainfall. Due to higher pollution levels, populations in more<lb/> urbanized regions and countries will experience greater<lb/> sensitivity to allergens. <ref type="biblio">22</ref> These factors may help to explain<lb/> the variation between countries seen in this survey and those<lb/> recently reported in a broader range of countries. <ref type="biblio">23<lb/></ref></p>

 CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>Results from this survey highlight the range of allergic<lb/> symptoms that negatively impact the lifestyle of people with<lb/> AR. Patients clearly want treatment options that improve their<lb/> QoL and restore their ability to engage in activities of daily<lb/> living.</p>
