			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Cancer has been the leading cause of mortality in Japan since 1981, causing<lb/> approximately 380,000 deaths per year in 2020. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> However, the five-year relative survival rate has<lb/> exceeded 60% since 2009. <ref type="biblio">2<lb/></ref> Approaches to cancer treatment have also been changing in Japan. The number of<lb/> domestic outpatients with malignant neoplasms now exceeds the number of inpatients, a trend<lb/> that has increased in recent years. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> This change is due to a variety of factors currently occurring<lb/> in Japan, including the limited number of beds available at inpatient facilities, the promotion of<lb/> home care, and advances in cancer drug therapy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Oncology pharmacotherapy is diversifying with the introduction of cytotoxic anticancer<lb/> agents, molecular targeted agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), all of which have<lb/> completely different mechanisms from conventional immunotherapy. <ref type="biblio">4-8</ref> As of 2019, three ICIs<lb/> had either been approved or were undergoing clinical trials in Japan: CTLA-4 inhibitors, PD-1<lb/> inhibitors, and PD-L1 inhibitors. These have since been approved for nine types of cancer, <ref type="biblio">4</ref> and<lb/> clinical trials with these ICIs are being conducted for more than 25 cancer types. These trials are<lb/> expected to result in additional indications for many cancer types and stages.<lb/></p>

			<p>The mode of action behind immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by ICI therapy<lb/> remains unknown. It is also unclear why some patients experience irAEs, while others do not.<lb/></p>

			<p>Managing irAEs is different from managing the side effects of cytotoxic anticancer drug therapy.<lb/> This is because irAEs appear in various forms and can, theoretically, occur anywhere in the<lb/> body. Moreover, it is difficult to predict when they will appear, and delays in appropriate<lb/> response and treatment can be fatal. <ref type="biblio">4,9,10</ref> However, there is no established treatment or supportive<lb/> care beyond the use of steroids. <ref type="biblio">4</ref> Additionally, recent studies have shown that the risk of<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> mortality and disease progression is reduced when irAEs occur. <ref type="biblio">11,12</ref> Thus, recognizing and<lb/> managing irAEs is a critical factor for ensuring that patients continue to receive the treatment<lb/> they require.<lb/></p>

			<p>Against this background, nurses must have adequate knowledge of ICI treatment and any<lb/> associated irAEs. <ref type="biblio">13</ref> However, although nurses must possess knowledge related to the medications<lb/> used for each patient, their actual acquisition of such knowledge remains insufficient. <ref type="biblio">14,15<lb/></ref> According to the results of a survey of 160 nurses involved in clinical practice and education in<lb/> various fields, nurses are aware of the need to provide nursing care based on evidence-based<lb/> knowledge; however, they have difficulty translating this knowledge into practice. <ref type="biblio">16<lb/></ref> As ICI therapy is likely to become a mainstream cancer treatment in the near future, nurses<lb/> need to acquire knowledge about ICI therapy and irAEs. However, the current status of nurses&apos;<lb/> knowledge about ICIs and irAEs and the recognition of their importance in Japan have not yet<lb/> been clarified. Furthermore, globally, there is no research or questionnaire assessing ICI and<lb/> irAE knowledge. At present, supportive care for adverse events associated with ICI therapy has<lb/> not been established. As such, it is vital for nurses to have appropriate knowledge regarding<lb/> irAEs to ensure early detection and treatment, thereby reducing distress among patients and their<lb/></p>

			<p>families. An appropriate level of knowledge is also needed to ensure that effective treatment can<lb/> be safely continued and sufficient therapeutic effects are realized.<lb/></p>

			<p>This study aimed to test the following research hypotheses by examining knowledge of<lb/> ICIs and irAEs-and the factors affecting that knowledge-among outpatient nurses involved in<lb/> the care of patients undergoing ICI treatment in Japan. This study seeks to contribute to the field<lb/> by analyzing the hypotheses based on a conceptual diagram of knowledge, attributes, and<lb/> awareness of irAEs <ref type="biblio">(Figure)</ref>. Since no theoretical framework existed, the conceptual diagram<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> was originally schematized by the author. Knowledge of ICIs and irAEs is associated with<lb/> personal attributes and environmental characteristics. Awareness of irAEs is associated with<lb/> personal attributes, environmental characteristics, and knowledge of ICIs and irAEs. Personal<lb/> attributes are in turn associated with environmental characteristics.<lb/></p>

			<p>Hypothesis 1: Nurses who study ICIs and irAEs gain adequate knowledge compared to<lb/> those who do not.<lb/></p>

			<p>Hypothesis 2: Knowledge of ICIs and irAEs among nurses involved in ICI treatment<lb/> would be associated with nurses&apos; personal attributes, such as irAE management training<lb/> participants, providing opportunities for learning about irAEs, and the number of ICI-<lb/>administered patients involved in care to date. A null hypothesis will be tested to the effect that<lb/> there is no association between knowledge of irAEs and nurses&apos; personal attributes, such as irAE<lb/> management training participants, providing opportunities for learning about irAEs, and the<lb/> number of ICI-administered patients involved in care.<lb/></p>

			<p>Hypothesis 3: Knowledge of ICIs and irAEs among nurses involved in ICI treatment<lb/> would be associated between two groups of nurses&apos; environmental characteristics, such as the<lb/> presence of an in-house multidisciplinary team, certified cancer-related personnel, and an ICI-<lb/>specific questionnaire in the facility. A null hypothesis will be tested to the effect that there is no<lb/> association between knowledge of irAEs and nurses&apos; environmental characteristics, such as the<lb/> presence of an in-house multidisciplinary team, certified cancer-related personnel, and an ICI-<lb/>specific questionnaire in the facility.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Methods<lb/> 2.1 Design<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/></head>

			<p>This was an exploratory cross-sectional study using an internet-based self-administered<lb/> questionnaire.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 Setting<lb/></head>

			<p>A total of 450 facilities in Japan were included in this study, including 447 designated<lb/> comprehensive cancer centers and 86 advanced treatment hospitals that do not overlap with the<lb/> designated comprehensive cancer centers. <ref type="biblio">17,18<lb/></ref> A research request letter, a sample questionnaire, a sample research cooperation request<lb/> form for cooperating nurses, and a reply-paid postcard were sent to the head of the nursing<lb/> department of the facility where the survey was conducted. The return postcards were sent by the<lb/> head of the nursing department of the facility where the survey was to be conducted, with the<lb/> name of the person in charge of accepting the survey and the number of possible collaborators<lb/> indicated. Based on the returned postcards, a &quot;Request for Research Cooperation Form&quot; was<lb/> mailed to the person in charge of accepting the survey at facilities that agreed to cooperate. The<lb/> form included the purpose of the study and the URL and 2D code to access the Internet survey<lb/> for the cooperating nurses. The research coordinator distributed this form to nurses who were<lb/> involved in ICI administration nursing in the outpatient chemotherapy centers and outpatient<lb/> treatment centers of gastroenterology and respiratory medicine, or similar departments, and<lb/> requested their responses via the Internet.<lb/></p>

			<p>The data collection period was from June to September 2020.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3 Participants<lb/></head>

			<p>The survey targets were nurses working in departments involved in the care of patients<lb/> undergoing ICI treatment at the concerned facilities. The survey did not ask whether participants<lb/> held certifications, such as certified cancer chemotherapy nursing or cancer nursing specialist in<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> oncology.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4 Sample Size Calculation<lb/></head>

			<p>The total number of items calculated for the sample size was 35, which included 10 main<lb/> attribute items from the 26 attribute items considered and selected to be particularly influential<lb/> on irAE management, eight awareness items (7 questions and 1 free comment), nine items<lb/> testing knowledge about ICIs and irAEs, and eight items on the various types of irAEs. The<lb/> required minimum sample size was set at 175, five times the number of items. <ref type="biblio">19</ref> Assuming that<lb/> the response rate will be 25%, the number of required participants was calculated to be 700<lb/> (=175/0.25). The number of facilities requested was calculated to be 281 (=70/0.25) assuming a<lb/> minimum of 70 facilities and a response rate of 25%, based on the assumption that 10 nurses<lb/> from one facility would respond to the survey.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.5 Questionnaire<lb/> 2.5.1 Test of ICI and irAE Knowledge<lb/></head>

			<p>Questions related to basic knowledge of ICIs and irAEs were based on the Cancer<lb/> Immunotherapy Guidelines (second edition), <ref type="biblio">4</ref> National Comprehensive Cancer Network<lb/> guidelines, <ref type="biblio">6</ref> and previous studies. <ref type="biblio">8,17,18.20-26</ref> The survey consisted of ten items meant to extract<lb/> participants&apos; basic knowledge about ICIs and irAEs, specific symptoms of irAEs by area,<lb/> frequency of occurrence, severity (mortality rate), and urgency as well as specific symptom<lb/> measures and non-steroidal treatment. Knowledge scores were based on whether participants<lb/> answered the true/false questions correctly.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nine oncologists, pulmonary physicians, oncology certificated nurse specialists, and<lb/> certified cancer chemotherapy nurses were asked to evaluate the content validity of the ICI and<lb/> irAE knowledge test in terms of appropriateness, difficulty, necessity, and modifications. The<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> appropriateness, difficulty, and necessity of each item were rated on a three-point Likert-type<lb/> scale (3, high; 2, neither; 1, low); the mean scores were 2.4, 2.1, and 2.7, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>Modifications were made based on these results.<lb/></p>

			<p>A pilot survey of the modified ICI and irAE knowledge test was conducted with three<lb/> nurses working at a designated comprehensive cancer center. The items were then re-examined<lb/> and finalized.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.5.2 Awareness of irAEs<lb/></head>

			<p>Eight questions related to irAE awareness were set by referring to the item on side effects<lb/> in the &quot;31 items of nursing practice for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,&quot; <ref type="biblio">14</ref> replacing<lb/> chemotherapy and its associated side effects with ICIs and irAEs, respectively. The response<lb/> format was a five-point Likert scale.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) <ref type="biblio">27</ref> was applied to set up the answers for question 7,<lb/> &quot;plan to learn about irAEs.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>2.5.3 Attributes (Personal Attributes and Environmental Characteristics)<lb/></head>

			<p>A total of 26 items were asked based on multiple sources, including 20 items related to<lb/> personal attributes and six related to environmental characteristics that are considered influential<lb/> in the acquisition of cancer care expertise. Participants were asked to select applicable items or<lb/> write freely.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.6 Data Analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>We performed a variance, correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis with<lb/> attributes (personal attributes and environmental characteristics) and awareness of irAEs (7<lb/> questions and 1 free comment) as the independent variables and irAE knowledge test scores as<lb/> the dependent variable.<lb/></p>

			<head>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/></head>

			<p>The knowledge test score was calculated as one point for each of the 41 questions in the<lb/> ten domains, resulting in a total of 41 points for the knowledge test score. Additionally, each of<lb/> the irAE question options (Q3 through Q10: total 32 options) was divided into two categories<lb/> (except Q1 and Q2, which were ICI-related questions): knowledge required for general cancer<lb/> nursing (12 options) and knowledge required for nursing specific to ICI (20 options), with one<lb/> point each for a total of 32 points. The average percentage of correct answers was calculated.<lb/> SPSS Statistics version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for analysis, and the<lb/> significance level was set at .05%.<lb/></p>

			<p>In accordance with the hypothesis, the knowledge test scores on ICIs and irAEs were used<lb/> as the dependent variable and the other variables were used as independent variables to examine<lb/> the influencing factors.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.7 Ethical Considerations<lb/></head>

			<p>This study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Research Ethics Review<lb/> Committee of an international university (approval no. 20-A018). All participants provided<lb/> written informed consent.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Results<lb/> 3.1 The Number of Survey Participants and Response Rate<lb/></head>

			<p>We sent a letter in advance to 281 nurse directors at the target facilities, which were<lb/> randomly selected from 450 eligible facilities, requesting their participation. Nurse directors<lb/> approached nurses who were involved in ICI administration nursing in the outpatient department,<lb/> where cancer patients with indications for ICIs are treated. We sent 538 request letters to 109<lb/> facilities (63%) that agreed to cooperate (38%). We received responses from 196 (36%), and 192<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> valid responses were obtained (valid response rate: 35%). Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarizes the basic<lb/> attributes of the participants.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 General Data<lb/></head>

			<p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarizes the basic attributes of the participants.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3 Nurses` Knowledge Level<lb/></head>

			<p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> presents the results of the ICI and irAE knowledge test. The mean score was 26.2<lb/> out of 41 (63.9% correct, standard deviation (SD) 5.48), and the median score was 26.5. Among<lb/> the individual questions, nine questions on ICI and irAE general knowledge were excluded<lb/> because they combined the two types of knowledge, preventing individual measurement of ICI-<lb/>and irAE-specific knowledge. The remaining questions were divided into ICI-or irAE-specific<lb/> knowledge (20 questions, &quot;a&quot; in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) and general knowledge necessary for cancer nursing<lb/> (12 questions, &quot;b&quot; in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The average percentage of correct answers for general knowledge<lb/> of cancer nursing was higher than the average percentage of total correct answers, while the<lb/> average percentage of correct answers for ICI-specific knowledge was lower. This was also true<lb/> for the percentage of correct answers for each of the irAE topics; the percentage of correct<lb/> answers was higher for the general knowledge questions and lower for the questions with more<lb/> ICI-specific options. The irAE topics that exceeded the average percentage of correct answers for<lb/> all questions were pulmonary dysfunction (41.7%) and hepatic dysfunction (27.1%). The<lb/> reliability coefficient (Cronbach&apos;s alpha) for the knowledge test was 0.79.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4 Influencing Factors: Single Factor Analysis<lb/> 3.4.1 Personal Attributes and Environmental Characteristics Associated with Knowledge<lb/> Test Scores<lb/></head>

			<p>The relationships between the knowledge test scores and the nominal variables of personal<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> attributes and environmental characteristics are shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The significant personal<lb/> attributes were the number of beds, current department, certification held, highest level of<lb/> nursing educational background, academic society affiliation, participation in irAE management<lb/> training, experience with currently predictable irAEs, experience with currently unpredictable<lb/> irAEs, existence of free self-study, existence of paid self-study, and affiliation with ICI-related<lb/> multidisciplinary teams in the hospital. The significant environmental characteristics were the<lb/> presence of certified personnel in the hospital, use of an ICI-specific questionnaire, and presence<lb/> of a patient education tool (p &lt; .05).<lb/></p>

			<p>The continuous variables of personal attributes and environmental characteristics that were<lb/> correlated with ICI and irAE knowledge test scores by correlation coefficients were significantly<lb/> different by years of experience in cancer nursing, number of certifications held, number of<lb/> academic society affiliations, number of free self-study opportunities/modes, number of paid<lb/> self-study opportunities/modes, number of in-hospital certified personnel, number of irAE<lb/> confirmation tools, and number of patient education tools. The correlation coefficients were<lb/> weak, ranging from 0.2 to 0.4.<lb/></p>

			<p>The ICI and irAE knowledge test scores for irAE management training participants were<lb/> significantly higher, with a mean score of 28.5 (SD 4.80) and a median score of 29, than the<lb/> scores of participants who had not participated in such training.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of the mean and median scores for the number of self-learning<lb/> opportunities/modes, there was a difference in scores between the &quot;free&quot; group with two or fewer<lb/> opportunities/modes and the &quot;paid&quot; group with three or more opportunities/modes. There was<lb/> also a difference between the paid group with one or no opportunities/modes and the paid group<lb/> with two or more opportunities/modes. Therefore, we set up groups according to the number of<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> items for which a difference in scores was observed: two or fewer and three or more for the free<lb/> group, and one or more for the paid group. We then compared these groups using Mann-<lb/>Whitney U tests. The results showed that there was a significant difference in knowledge<lb/> depending on the number of free self-study opportunities/modes (between two or fewer and three<lb/> or more [p=.000]) and the number of paid self-study opportunities/modes (between one or no<lb/> opportunities and two or more [p=.004]).<lb/></p>

			<p>Those with fewer than five years of clinical experience (n=4) scored higher on the<lb/> knowledge test (mean 30.5 SD 5.74, median 31). However, those with fewer than five years of<lb/> oncology nursing experience (n=44, mean 18 years of clinical experience) scored lower (mean<lb/> 23.7 SD 7.84, median 21). Although there was no significant difference in knowledge test scores<lb/> for either years of clinical experience or of oncology nursing experience, correct responses were<lb/> higher in the group with six or more years of clinical experience than in that with one to five<lb/> years of experience. Scores were also higher for those with oncology nursing experience than for<lb/> those without.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on the results of the above analysis, the personal attributes and environmental<lb/> characteristics that were related or correlated with the knowledge test scores were certifications<lb/> held, academic society affiliation, free self-learning opportunities/media, irAE confirmation<lb/> tools, and patient education tools.<lb/></p>

			<p>Regarding learning status, participants with previously predicted and unpredicted irAEs<lb/> used multiple self-learning opportunities/modes. Furthermore, more than two-thirds of them<lb/> indicated that they were already engaged in learning (more than six months and six months or<lb/> under).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4.2 Examination of Awareness of irAEs as Related to Knowledge Test Scores<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/></head>

			<p>The relationships between ICI and irAE knowledge test scores and awareness of irAEs are<lb/> shown in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Free comments (n=23) on the awareness of irAEs are shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>; the<lb/> relationships between ICI and irAE knowledge test scores could not be analyzed due to<lb/> insufficient data. The results showed that independence was dismissed in knowledge test scores<lb/> and awareness of irAEs, with &quot;calling on oneself to identify irAEs,&quot; &quot;patient education on the<lb/> purpose of irAE prevention and coping behaviors is important,&quot; &quot;improving knowledge of the<lb/> antitumor effects and adverse events of the drugs administered to each patient is important,&quot; and<lb/> &quot;learning schedule for irAEs&quot; were significantly different (p &lt; .05). Hence, an association was<lb/> observed.<lb/></p>

			<p>No association was found between &quot;early detection of irAEs is the physician&apos;s role&quot; and<lb/> knowledge test scores. There was a significant difference between the &quot;agree&quot; and &quot;neither agree<lb/> nor disagree&quot; groups (multiple comparison method). The &quot;neither agree nor disagree&quot; group had<lb/> higher knowledge test scores. &quot;It is the physician&apos;s role&quot; and &quot;it is not the physician&apos;s role&quot;<lb/> groups had lower scores than the &quot;neither agree nor disagree&quot; group.<lb/></p>

			<p>The &quot;plan to learn&quot; item of the awareness of irAE variable was the most relevant to<lb/> knowledge test scores on ICIs and irAEs.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4.3 Influencing Factors: Multiple Regression Analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>The multiple linear regression analysis results are shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>. We used a forced<lb/> imputation method to examine the relationship between ICI and irAE knowledge test scores and<lb/> the significant variables of attribute and irAE awareness.<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore, the standardized coefficients (β) of each of the variables in the questionnaire<lb/> showed that &quot;plan to learn&quot; and &quot;certifications held&quot; influenced the knowledge test scores, but<lb/> the significant probability was p &lt; .05 for &quot;plan to learn.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>In this section, we examine the relationship between the items based on the obtained<lb/> results and discuss future strategies for nurses to acquire knowledge.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 Characteristics of the Target Population<lb/></head>

			<p>More than 70% of the participants were nurses in their 40s or older and working in<lb/> medium-sized or larger facilities. This sample is slightly older than the general population of<lb/> nurses in Japan, where just under 50% of hospital nurses are in their 40s or older. <ref type="biblio">28</ref> More than<lb/> 70% of the nurses had experience of caring for more than 21 patients on ICI therapy, and nearly<lb/> 90% of the nurses worked in outpatient chemotherapy units, suggesting that this is a group<lb/> involved in cancer drug therapy daily.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Nurses` Knowledge Level<lb/></head>

			<p>As described earlier, the reliability coefficient (Cronbach&apos;s alpha) for the knowledge test<lb/> was 0.79. Therefore, the knowledge test used in this study remained reliable, and we believe it<lb/> was appropriate for measuring nurses&apos; knowledge on ICIs and irAEs in this aspect. Additionally,<lb/> in terms of awareness of irAEs, nearly 35% of the participants who answered &quot;already learning<lb/> (more than six months)&quot; to the question &quot;plan to learn about irAEs&quot; scored significantly higher<lb/> (mean 29.07, SD 3.95, median 30) than who did not. This suggests that the test was an<lb/> appropriate measure of the knowledge of those accessing learning opportunities.<lb/></p>

			<p>As per the result shown, in each of the irAE categories, only two categories had a higher-<lb/>than-average percentage of all questions answered correctly on the knowledge test: pulmonary<lb/> dysfunction (41.7%) and hepatic dysfunction (27.1%). We believe that the pulmonary<lb/> dysfunction knowledge score was the highest because of rising awareness among nurses about<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> reports of deaths because of the interstitial pulmonary dysfunction associated with ICI treatment<lb/> and also because the mortality rate of drug-induced pulmonary dysfunction due to cancer drug<lb/> therapy in Japan is higher than that in other countries. <ref type="biblio">30</ref> Based on the above, the probability that<lb/> nurses have been involved in the care of patients with cancer who develop drug-induced<lb/> pulmonary dysfunction is high, so it can be inferred that nurses are aware of this problem.<lb/></p>

			<p>In contrast, the knowledge scores for dermatological dysfunction (47.2%),<lb/> neurologic/musculoskeletal dysfunction (39.2%), endocrine dysfunction (46.3%), and cardiac<lb/> dysfunction (48.3%) were below the average percentage of each question answered correctly. In<lb/> these areas, a lack of penetration of disease-specific knowledge may be a factor. This is because<lb/> the incidence of irAE itself is in the single digits, and a variety of diseases are included in this<lb/> area. Although endocrine dysfunction also includes a variety of diseases, 56% of the participants<lb/> correctly answered, &quot;(c.) thyroid dysfunction is the least frequent endocrine dysfunction among<lb/> irAEs (incorrect).&quot; <ref type="biblio">4,6,7,20-22</ref> It is assumed that the participants were aware of thyroid dysfunction,<lb/> which is relatively frequent among irAEs; this led to the acquisition of knowledge. For cardiac<lb/> dysfunction, the result indicates that the acquisition of knowledge about the general<lb/> cardiovascular system is also an issue.<lb/></p>

			<p>The distinctive results showed that correct response rates for gastrointestinal and<lb/> dermatological dysfunction, which are considered to occur more frequently among irAEs, <ref type="biblio">4,6,7,21-<lb/>23</ref> were lower than those for neurologic/musculoskeletal dysfunction. The incidence of<lb/> gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by ICIs is estimated to be 30%-40%, and fatalities, such as<lb/> those resulting from intestinal perforation, have been reported. Unlike gastrointestinal disorders<lb/> caused by cytotoxic anticancer drugs, the use of antidiarrheal agents may delay treatment for<lb/> irAEs and cause serious complications. <ref type="biblio">4,6-8</ref> However, the item-specific correct response rate was<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> low.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this knowledge test, questions related to general clinical symptoms and care were<lb/> avoided as much as possible because the target audience was nurses who were already engaged<lb/> in clinical practice. The test was composed of questions related to specialized knowledge of ICIs<lb/> and irAEs as well as specific clinical symptoms and responses. Furthermore, the percentage of<lb/> correct answers to irAE-specific questions, such as the frequency, timing, severity, and grade of<lb/> irAEs, was low. Therefore, it can be considered that the participants lacked knowledge of ICIs<lb/> and irAEs.<lb/></p>

			<p>According to the above data, we analyzed that nurses caring for cancer patients<lb/> undergoing ICI treatment need to further improve their basic knowledge of ICIs and irAEs<lb/> especially the frequency of incidence or are prone to become severe irAEs. Furthermore, the<lb/> study found that nurses urgently need to acquire knowledge about low occurrence fatal irAEs.<lb/></p>

			<p>For preventing irAEs, it is significant to first know the immune-toxicity spectrum <ref type="biblio">13</ref> , especially<lb/> for early detection of irAEs, which is one of the most significant roles of nurses caring for<lb/> patients undergoing ICI treatment.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 Influencing Factors of the Knowledge Test Scores and Attributes<lb/></head>

			<p>The ICI and irAE knowledge test scores for irAE management training participants were<lb/> significantly higher than the scores of participants who had not participated in such training<lb/> programs. Although participation in training programs is an effective means of acquiring<lb/> knowledge, further intervention studies are needed because nurses who already possess the<lb/> required knowledge may participate in training programs to acquire further knowledge.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nurses who engaged in self-learning had significantly higher knowledge test scores than<lb/> those who did not. On the contrary, there was no significant difference in knowledge test scores<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> when only a single learning opportunity or mode was accessed, and the knowledge test scores<lb/> were significantly higher when three or more free learning opportunities or modes were accessed<lb/> or two or more paid learning opportunities or modes were accessed. This suggests that the use of<lb/> multiple self-learning systems possibly in combination with a paid system will enable effective<lb/> learning for knowledge acquisition.<lb/></p>

			<p>Furthermore, the knowledge test scores were significantly higher for participants who<lb/> answered &quot;yes&quot; to the questions on experience with predictable or unpredictable irAEs than for<lb/> those who answered &quot;no&quot; to predictable irAEs. In other words, those who indicated that they had<lb/> experience with predictable or unpredictable irAEs had already acquired knowledge of irAEs and<lb/> were likely to provide nursing care with awareness of irAEs.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results of this study showed a trend in terms of the extent of experience and<lb/> institutional attributes of the target population; working in a specialized comprehensive cancer<lb/> center did not significantly affect the level of expertise. Additionally, nurses working in general<lb/> hospitals and university hospitals maintain their knowledge due to diverse associations. Although<lb/> the sample size was small, the knowledge test scores were higher in those with fewer than five<lb/> years of clinical experience (n=4; mean 30.5, SD 5.74, median 31). We can assume that after<lb/> they graduated from a nursing educational institution, they were assigned to an outpatient<lb/> chemotherapy center or outpatient department as nurses with recently updated knowledge.<lb/></p>

			<p>There was no significant difference in knowledge test scores according to the number of<lb/> years of clinical experience or the number of years of oncology nursing experience. However,<lb/> the percentage of correct answers increased with the number of years of clinical experience.<lb/></p>

			<p>There was also no significant difference in knowledge test scores according to the number of<lb/> years of experience working in comprehensive cancer centers or chemotherapy centers.<lb/></p>

			<head>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/></head>

			<p>Furthermore, those with six to ten years of experience working in comprehensive cancer centers<lb/> had the lowest scores compared to the overall group without work experience in comprehensive<lb/> cancers. Additionally, the scores of those with fewer than five years of oncology nursing<lb/> experience (n=44; mean 18 years of clinical experience) were the lowest (mean 23.7, SD 7.84,<lb/> median 21). These results suggest that nurses&apos; knowledge acquisition is highly influenced by the<lb/> environment in which they are placed, for instance the availability of ICI-specific questionnaires<lb/> and patient education tools.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nurses using ICI-specific questionnaires, irAE confirmation tool, and patient education<lb/> tool had significantly higher knowledge test scores than those who did not. As nurses use these<lb/> tools to make direct explanations to patients, it is highly likely that nurses learn about irAEs<lb/> ahead of time, before explaining them to patients, or that they learn about them through such<lb/> patient explanations. This will likely be an opportunity to acquire knowledge not only for nurses<lb/> with limited experience, as mentioned earlier, but also for nurses involved in such situations.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.4 Influencing Factors of Knowledge and Awareness of irAEs<lb/></head>

			<p>Participants who answered &quot;agree (it is important)&quot; to the questions on the importance of<lb/> talking to patients, educating patients, and improving their own knowledge had significantly<lb/> higher knowledge test scores. It can be assumed that a high knowledge test score is a result of<lb/> learning, which further results in confidence in nursing. It can also be assumed that nurses select<lb/> and implement appropriate nursing care based on specific information, theories, and methods;<lb/> that is, the patient is approached and the irAE is confirmed. <ref type="biblio">29<lb/></ref> There was a significant difference in the response to the question on whether early<lb/> detection of irAEs is the physician&apos;s responsibility when an in-house ICI-related<lb/> multidisciplinary team exists. Moreover, the presence of qualified personnel in the hospital, or in<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> a nurse&apos;s own department, was significantly related to nurses talking to patients themselves;<lb/> however, no significant relationship was found with &quot;plan to learn.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>4.5 Future Suggestions for Knowledge Acquisition<lb/></head>

			<p>Regarding the question on &quot;plan to learn&quot; in the questions on awareness of irAEs, the<lb/> transtheoretical model (TTM) <ref type="biblio">32</ref> was used. The finding indicates that further research is needed to<lb/> determine the kind of approach that should be adopted in the future to educate the 30% who were<lb/> in the contemplation and precontemplation stages. In this study, nearly 95% of the nurses<lb/> indicated that they used free learning opportunities/modes for self-improvement, including<lb/> seminars, lectures, training sessions, conference-produced materials, and e-learning. The TTM<lb/> considers the use of these modes to be part of the preparation stage.<lb/></p>

			<p>Additionally, computerized interactive interventions may lead to significant results in<lb/> terms of behavior changes. <ref type="biblio">27</ref> Digital tools such as apps and social networking sites, which were<lb/> among the answer choices for learning opportunities/modes currently used, were not mentioned<lb/> in the survey results. However, the participants freely stated that they would learn if online<lb/> learning materials and tools were available or if they had the time and schedule flexibility to<lb/> participate. Thus, it is possible that on-demand digital tools that are interactive and can be<lb/> completed at any pace, according to one&apos;s own convenience, would be useful.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.6 Limitations and Future Challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>As mentioned earlier, the content of the irAE knowledge test was extracted from the<lb/> Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines 4 and relevant literature. <ref type="biblio">6-8,20-22,31,32</ref> The test was then<lb/> confirmed by an expert panel. However, further validation is needed to evaluate the reliability of<lb/> the test as a knowledge test on ICIs and irAEs. Additionally, further research is needed to<lb/> evaluate the correct response rate of this test, including validation and different target groups.<lb/></p>

			<head>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/></head>

			<p>In this survey, about 90% of the participants were nurses who care for patients<lb/> undergoing anticancer drug therapy in outpatient chemotherapy units or outpatient infusion<lb/> centers. In the future, it will be necessary to devise recruitment methods so that more nurses who<lb/> provide cancer nursing care at general outpatient clinics or best supportive care units can be<lb/> included. The reason is that most patients receiving ICI treatment have intervals between<lb/> administration (two to six weeks <ref type="biblio">20,21</ref> ); irAEs may occur late after the completion of<lb/> treatment, <ref type="biblio">4,9,20-22</ref> and the occurrence of irAEs may require permanent treatment for irAEs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Additionally, ICIs may be combined with other cancer drugs or radiation therapy based on new<lb/> regimen approvals. The management of irAEs resulting from ICIs requires educating patients<lb/> prior to treatment and providing ongoing support through multiple methods tailored to each<lb/> patient. <ref type="biblio">13,31</ref> In parallel, nurses need to know what to ask and how to respond to patients, and they<lb/> must have experience and knowledge of the treatment and underlying disease so that they can<lb/> distinguish complications. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> Nurses play a role not only in preventing physical deterioration<lb/> through early detection of irAEs but also in supporting patients to continue the necessary or<lb/> desired treatment over the mid-to-long-term period. Considering the above, it is necessary to<lb/> further verify the results of this study by conducting an additional survey that fully addresses the<lb/> context of these participants.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>This study revealed that there is room for nurses to acquire more knowledge about ICIs<lb/> and irAEs, as ICI pharmacotherapy occupies an important position in cancer treatment.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on the suggestions from the study findings and in light of the above, specific<lb/> consideration should be given to computerized interactive tools that are appropriate to the<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> nurses&apos; stage of knowledge acquisition, to building an ICI-related multidisciplinary team or a<lb/> potential substitute for such a team at hospitals, and to increasing nurses&apos; awareness of their role<lb/> in confronting patients by providing specific information on how appropriate feedback and<lb/> change can lead to positive outcomes for patients. A challenge for the future is to build multiple<lb/> effective knowledge acquisition opportunities through patient education tools, questionnaires,<lb/> and other direct patient media and linking them to behavior change. Based on the present results,<lb/> the possibility of clinical application to the acquisition of knowledge in other fields and other<lb/> treatment methods should also be considered.<lb/></p>
