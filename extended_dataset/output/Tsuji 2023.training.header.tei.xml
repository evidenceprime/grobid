	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Objective: Adequate knowledge of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and associated<lb/> immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is essential for managing such events. However, the level<lb/> of knowledge among Japanese nurses remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the<lb/> current status of ICIs and irAE knowledge and the factors influencing them, among outpatient<lb/> nurses caring for patients undergoing ICI treatment.<lb/> Methods: An exploratory cross-sectional study was conducted at 450 facilities nationwide.<lb/> Participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire consisting of three parts,<lb/> measuring personal and environmental attributes and awareness and knowledge of irAEs.<lb/> Questions were based on multiple literature sources and were evaluated and validated by medical<lb/> oncologists and certified oncology nurses.<lb/> Results: A total of 196 (response rate: 36%) nurses responded to the survey at 109 facilities<lb/> (valid responses: 192; rate: 35%). The correct response rate was 27.6% for questions on general<lb/> ICI knowledge and 15.6% for general irAE knowledge. Questions on pulmonary dysfunction had<lb/> the highest correct response rate (41.7%), while those on neuromuscular/joint dysfunction had<lb/> the lowest (1%). The mean correct response rates were 76% for general knowledge and 48.1%<lb/> for ICI-specific knowledge. Multiple regression analysis showed that the most influential factor<lb/> was participants&apos; study schedule (p&lt;.05).<lb/> J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f<lb/> Conclusions: There is room for nurses to acquire additional knowledge about ICIs and irAEs.<lb/> The use of patient education tools and a study schedule significantly increased knowledge scores.<lb/> Further research is needed to identify when and how to provide nurses with opportunities to<lb/> acquire additional ICI and irAE-related knowledge.<lb/></div>
