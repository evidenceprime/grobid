			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The number of Canadians affected by allergies is<lb/> estimated at 8.4 million <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. The prevalence of physician-<lb/>diagnosed allergic rhinitis was estimated at 20% in a<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Page 2 of 5<lb/> Ellis et al. Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol<lb/> (2020) 16:15<lb/> structured telephone interview of 3671 Canadians over<lb/> the age of 18 [5].<lb/></figure>

			<p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms present a substantial<lb/> burden to patients&apos; everyday lives. When comparing the<lb/> burden of allergic rhinitis to depression, hypertension<lb/> and diabetes mellitus, allergic rhinitis was second<lb/> only to depression in its impact on work productivity<lb/> and restriction of daily activities <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. An online survey<lb/> examined the impact of nasal and ocular allergy<lb/> symptoms in 1001 patients <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. Fifty percent of patients<lb/> reported impaired daily activities and/or increased<lb/> distraction, irritability, fatigue and frustration as a result<lb/> of symptoms <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. Allergic rhinitis symptoms have also<lb/> been found to negatively impact both sexual function and<lb/> sleep as evaluated by the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index,<lb/> a validated outcomes tool <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite treatment, a high percentage of AR patients<lb/> have uncontrolled symptoms. In a structured telephone<lb/> interview of Canadian patients with physician diagnosed<lb/> allergic rhinitis, 66% indicated that their lifestyle was<lb/> limited despite using medications for their allergies and<lb/> 61% felt their symptoms were only somewhat or poorly/<lb/> not controlled <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Allergen specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only<lb/> allergy treatment that modifies the underlying disease<lb/> process <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. Two forms of AIT are approved for use in<lb/> Canada, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT)<lb/> via injection, or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)<lb/> delivered in a tablet form.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Allergy Patient Identification for Immunotherapy<lb/> (AsPIRe) Program investigated similarities and<lb/> differences between allergist and patient perceptions<lb/> of seasonal allergy symptoms and their impact on daily<lb/> living. The program also looked at patient and physician<lb/> attitudes toward available allergen immunotherapy<lb/> (AIT) modalities and patients&apos; likely acceptance of AIT if<lb/> offered as part of a seasonal allergy treatment approach.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/></head>

			<p>Thirty-nine allergists from across Canada were invited to<lb/> participate in the AsPIRe Program. Twenty-nine enrolled<lb/> and completed an on-line survey to collect demographic<lb/> information and baseline perceptions. Nineteen allergists<lb/> recruited patients who met the inclusion criteria: AIT-<lb/>na√Øve seasonal allergy patients with no contraindication<lb/> to AIT and at least 12 years of age.<lb/></p>

			<p>For each patient who was selected to participate<lb/> and met the inclusion criteria, the allergist and<lb/> patient completed paper-based parallel allergist and<lb/> patient questionnaires. Patients also received an AIT<lb/> informational booklet with their questionnaire. The<lb/> allergist survey was 7 questions in length and the patient<lb/> survey consisted of 12 questions (surveys available as<lb/> Additional files 1, 2).<lb/></p>

			<p>Results were tabulated and where comparable<lb/> questions were posed to both the patient and physician,<lb/> cross-tabulations of the results were done to examine any<lb/> similarities or patterns in the responses. A p-value test<lb/> was done to evaluate diagonal symmetry between the<lb/> patient and physician distribution of responses. A p-value<lb/> that is greater than 0.05 means there is no evidence for<lb/> lack of symmetry.<lb/></p>

			<p>Following tabulation of the parallel allergist and patient<lb/> paper-based surveys, the results were communicated to<lb/> the participating allergists.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/> Baseline characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>The survey was in field from February 2018 to June 2018.<lb/> A total of 141 allergist surveys and 136 patient surveys<lb/> were completed. Provincial breakdown of surveys<lb/> returned was 40% from Ontario, Alberta 24%, Quebec<lb/> 24% and British Columbia 12%. The mean age of patients<lb/> was 30 years old (range 12-70), and 44% were male,<lb/> 56% female. 72% of patients reported seasonal allergies<lb/> of longer than 5 years duration and in this subset of<lb/> patients, 46% were at their first allergist visit.<lb/></p>

			<head>Impact of allergy symptoms<lb/></head>

			<p>When questioned about the impact of specific symptoms,<lb/> both patients and allergists rated nasal symptoms as the<lb/> most bothersome. On a five-point scale, the mean was<lb/> calculated and patients reported blocked nose (3.9) and<lb/> sneezing (3.7) as the most bothersome while allergists<lb/> rated blocked nose (3.7) and runny nose (3.4) as the<lb/> most bothersome. Conversely, headaches and quantity<lb/> and quality of sleep were rated least bothersome by both<lb/> patients and allergists. Agreement between the patient<lb/> and allergist was highest for blocked nose being the<lb/> most bothersome symptom (p-value test of symmetry<lb/> p = 0.66).<lb/></p>

			<p>Analysis of the data showed that while 40% of patients<lb/> reported being affected by their allergy symptoms<lb/> 6-7 days a week, only 14% of allergists felt their patients<lb/> suffered with a similar frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Both allergists<lb/> and patients reported attendance and performance at<lb/> work and school as the quality of life factors the least<lb/> impacted on a daily basis by their allergy symptoms.<lb/></p>

			<head>Awareness of AIT<lb/></head>

			<p>Fifty-eight percent of patients reported they were aware<lb/> of AIT before completing the survey. Of the 58% who<lb/> were aware of AIT, 49% had been informed by their<lb/> allergist while 26% had heard about AIT from friends<lb/> and family (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Of note, only 7% of patients had been<lb/> made aware of AIT by the internet.<lb/></p>

			<head>Patient preference for type of AIT<lb/></head>

			<p>Patient responses showed that 76% of patients indicated<lb/> they would be likely or very likely to try sublingual<lb/> immunotherapy (SLIT) if recommended by their allergist<lb/> compared to 31% for subcutaneous immunotherapy<lb/> (SCIT) (Figs. <ref type="figure">3 and 4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Conversely, 8% of patients reported they would be<lb/> unlikely or very unlikely to try SLIT compared to 50%<lb/> of patients who would be unlikely or very unlikely to try<lb/> SCIT if recommended by their allergist.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>Comparing the patient and physician questionnaires<lb/> demonstrated a gap in perception between allergists<lb/> and their patients as to the impact of allergy symptoms<lb/> on daily life. In this cohort, compared to their allergists,<lb/> patients were nearly 3 times more likely to report that<lb/> allergy symptoms impacted their daily life 6-7 days a<lb/> week. The magnitude of difference between the impact<lb/> on daily life assessed by allergists and the impact<lb/> reported by patients would be expected to be of clinical<lb/> significance. This underscores that patients are not as<lb/> well controlled as their allergists may conclude.<lb/></p>

			<p>To provide patients with better allergic rhinitis control,<lb/> their management requires collaboration between<lb/> allergists and patients, including a presentation of all<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 1 Physician and patient response: effect of symptoms on daily<lb/> life (daily living activities/regular day-to-day life)<lb/> Fig. 2 Patient awareness of AIT: source of information<lb/> Fig. 3 Likelihood to use SLIT: allergist likelihood to prescribe versus<lb/> patient likelihood to use<lb/> Fig. 4 Likelihood to use SCIT: allergist likelihood to prescribe versus<lb/> patient likelihood to use<lb/> therapeutic options. The Canadian Society of Allergy<lb/> and Clinical Immunology recommends immunotherapy<lb/> should be considered in patients whose rhinitis and lower<lb/> airway symptoms are triggered by allergen exposure and<lb/> who have not achieved sufficient control with or have not<lb/> tolerated conventional pharmacotherapy, or do not want<lb/> to be on ongoing or long-term pharmacotherapy [6].<lb/></figure>

			<p>Patients showed a c preference for initiating SLIT vs<lb/> SCIT if it were to be recommended by their allergist. Half<lb/> of patients were not likely or not at all likely to initiate<lb/> SCIT if it were to be recommended by their allergist.<lb/> In contrast, only 8% of patients were not likely or not<lb/> at all likely to follow their allergist&apos;s recommendation<lb/> to initiate with SLIT. These results support the patient<lb/> preference for SLIT inferred by Damm et al. <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref> from<lb/> their discrete choice study showing preferences for fewer<lb/> physician visits and visits of shorter duration as their<lb/> preferred attributes of an AIT.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are clear limitations to this study. Firstly, we<lb/> had a small sample size and potential selection bias.<lb/> Allergists who were approached to participate were<lb/> known to be more generally receptive to participating<lb/> in studies and to prescribing AIT. Geographical<lb/> representation was not uniform across the country as<lb/> surveys were only completed by allergists and patients in<lb/> the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and<lb/> Quebec. A further limitation was the non-randomized<lb/> patient selection. Participating allergists decided which<lb/> individual patients to approach for participation and<lb/> this could have introduced selection bias. Additionally,<lb/> while the questionnaires used in the parallel physician-<lb/>patient survey were developed by the steering committee<lb/> members based on their clinical experience, and available<lb/> in English and French based on patient preference, they<lb/> were not validated tools.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>In this particular study cohort, there was a gap in<lb/> perception between allergists and their patients as to the<lb/> impact of allergy symptoms on daily life. Patients reported<lb/> being more frequently impacted versus their physician&apos;s<lb/> assessment. When asked about preference for AIT<lb/> options, this cohort of Canadian patients reported they<lb/> were more likely to follow their allergists&apos; recommendation<lb/> for initiation of SLIT compared to SCIT.</p>
