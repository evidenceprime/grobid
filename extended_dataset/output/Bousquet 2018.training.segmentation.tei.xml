			<body>Introduction <lb/>Measures of allergic rhinitis (AR) control include symptom scores, patients&apos; self-administered visual <lb/>analogue scales (VAS), objective measures of nasal obstruction, a recent modification of the ARIA <lb/>severity classification, or patients&apos; reported outcomes such as QOL or scores with several items (1, 2). <lb/>Mobile technology has been used to appraise AR control (3, 4). More information is however needed <lb/>to fully understand the importance of these novel approaches. <lb/>MASK-rhinitis (MACVIA-ARIA Sentinel NetworK for allergic rhinitis), an ICT system centred <lb/>around the patient (5), is one of the implementation tools of the B3 Action Plan of the European <lb/>Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP on AHA) (6). A mobile phone app <lb/>(Allergy Diary) central to MASK-rhinitis belongs to the Fondation Partenariale FMC VIA-LR <lb/>(Ministry of Education and Research, France). App users are asked to complete a short demographic <lb/>questionnaire, EQ-5D (7-10) and WPAI-AS (11, 12), thus providing baseline characteristics of their <lb/>disease. The Allergy Diary has been launched in 21 countries (3, 4). It was found to be an easy and <lb/>effective method of assessing symptoms of AR and work productivity. The ARIA score is also <lb/>available in the Allergy Diary adding the four components of the impact of AR (sleep, work and <lb/>school performance, daily activities and bothersome symptoms). <lb/>The ARIA score of the Allergy Diary was compared with QOL scores of EQ-5D (7-10) and WPAI-<lb/>AS (11, 12). <lb/>Methods <lb/>Design of the study <lb/>A cross-sectional study on a self-selected population was carried out from June 1, 2016 to June 1, <lb/>2017. EQ-5D (7-10) and/or WPAI-AS (11, 12) questionnaires are only available in some countries <lb/>and not all of the Allergy Diary users filled in these questionnaires as they are optional. All users <lb/>filled in the ARIA score. The ARIA score was compared with the EQ-5D visual analogue scale <lb/>(VAS) and Question 9 (degree allergy affected regular activities) of the WPAI-AS. <lb/>The study is reported according to STROBE. <lb/>Setting and users <lb/>All consecutive users from June 1, 2016 to June 1, 2017 who answered the questions of the EQ-5D <lb/>(7-10) and/or WPAI-AS (11, 12) were included in the study in 18 countries. Some demographic <lb/>characteristics (age, sex, country and language) were recorded. The App was used by people who <lb/>found it on Internet, Apple App store, Google Play store or any other way. A few users were clinic <lb/>patients that were asked by their physicians to use the app. However, due to anonymisation of data, no <lb/>specific information was gathered. <lb/>Accepted Article <lb/>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. <lb/>Allergy Diary <lb/>The app collects information on AR symptoms experienced (nasal and ocular), disease type <lb/>(intermittent/persistent), how symptoms impact users&apos; lives, and type(s) of AR treatment used (Table <lb/>1 online). The system has been deployed in 21 countries and in 16 languages (translated and back-<lb/>translated, culturally adapted and legally compliant). <lb/>Ethics <lb/>The Allergy Diary is CE1 registered but not considered by the Ethical Committee of the Cologne <lb/>hospital of the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency -GOV.UK) as a <lb/>medical device as it does not give any recommendations concerning treatment or diagnosis. The terms <lb/>of use, translated into all languages and customized according to each country&apos;s legislation, allow the <lb/>use of the results for research purposes. The data are anonymized except for geolocalized data that <lb/>are never totally anonymous. An Independent Review Board approval was not needed. <lb/>Outcomes <lb/>The ARIA score was calculated using the four Q4 questions of the Allergy Diary which include <lb/>impact on daily activities, work and sleep and troublesome symptoms (Table 1 online). Each of the 4 <lb/>items was ascribed a score of 1 (&quot;Yes&quot;) or 0 (&quot;No&quot;). The total ARIA score ranged from 0 (no <lb/>impairment) to 4 (severe impairment). <lb/>The electronic form of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (https://euroqol.org) was applied in the 10 <lb/>available languages (Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, <lb/>Spanish) (Online supplement 1) and we assessed the global VAS level and mobility impairment as <lb/>this was an absent domain in the assessment of AR impairment. <lb/>The electronic form of the WPAI-AS questionnaire was applied in the 10 available languages (same <lb/>as above for EQ-5D) (11, 12) according to the package obtained from Reilly and associates <lb/>(www.reillyassociates.net/WPAI_General.html). The percentage of impairment due to allergy for <lb/>daily activities (Q9) was the outcome used. (Online supplement 2). <lb/>Classification of users <lb/>Users with any positive answer to Q4 (Table 1 online) were classified as &quot;rhinitis&quot; (score 0-4). Those <lb/>with a score of zero were classified as &quot;no rhinitis&quot; if they had no symptom (Q3, Table 1 online). <lb/>Those with a positive answer were classified as &quot;rhinitis&quot; (score 0). <lb/>Statistical methods and analyses <lb/>Some users filled in EQ-5D or WPAI-AS more than once for a single day. The first data were then <lb/>used. A non-Gaussian distribution was found for some of the data (Shapiro-Wilk test). However, EQ-<lb/>5D data are usually reported in means and SD. Since the number of observations was large, we used <lb/>parametric analyses. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>Users <lb/>Of the 12,179 registered users, 1,287 filled in the EQ-5D questionnaire and 1,028 the WPAI-AS <lb/>questionnaire (Table 2 online). Among the 843 users who filled in both questionnaires, there were 507 <lb/>women (60%) and 336 men (40%), with a mean (± SD) age of 35 ± 14 years. <lb/>Main results <lb/>Similar levels of EQ-5D VAS and WPAI-AS Q9 were found for users with no rhinitis and for those <lb/>with an ARIA score of 0 to 2. There was a significant reduction of EQ-5D VAS levels and a <lb/>significant increase of WPAI-AS Q9 levels in users with an ARIA score of 3 or 4 (Table 1). <lb/>The repartition of users for both EQ-5D and WPAI-AS (Figure 1) shows that impairment occurred <lb/>significantly more commonly for ARIA scores of 3 and 4 than for ARIA scores of 0-3. There were <lb/>from 12 to 16% of users with an EQ-5D VAS level ≥60 in ARIA scores 0-2 whereas the level <lb/>increased to 26 and 27% in users with an ARIA score of 3 or 4. There were from 19 to 31% of users <lb/>with a Q9 ≥50 in ARIA scores of 0-2 whereas the level increased to 51 and 53% in users with an <lb/>ARIA score of 3 or 4. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>This pilot study using mobile technology showed that QOL data (EQ-5D VAS and WPAI-AS Q9) are <lb/>similar in users without rhinitis as in those with mild rhinitis (scores 0-2). Users with a score of 3 or 4 <lb/>had a significant impairment in QOL. <lb/>Strengths and limitations <lb/>The strengths and limitations of this study are those of mobile technology lengthily discussed <lb/>previously (3, 4). In particular, there is a lack of patient characterization that is impossible using an <lb/>App. However, every observational study we have performed using the Allergy Diary has confirmed <lb/>its interest and was able to identify users with a severe disease. It is likely that mobile technology will <lb/>become a very important tool for the understanding and management of AR. <lb/>One specific problem of the study is that there are more countries with EQ-5D or WPAI-AS reporting <lb/>than translations in the App. It is not known which translations were employed by users. <lb/>In this study, we did not perform sub-analyses assessing the importance of symptoms or other factors. <lb/>We did not investigate the treatments received. As this is a pilot study, these analyses will be carried <lb/>out once the number of users will have increased. <lb/></body>

			<body>Generalizability <lb/>The EQ-5D scores observed in the study accord with those of previous studies (8, 10). Users with an <lb/>ARIA score of 3 to 4 have a level similar to asthmatic patients with uncontrolled asthma (13, 14). <lb/>Because of the equal weighing score of ARIA, it is difficult to know whether these differences may be <lb/>due to specific symptoms (e.g. sleep). EQ-5D is a MAFEIP (Monitoring and assessment framework <lb/>for the EIP on AHA) tool (15) and the present study is in line with the EIP on AHA. This is another <lb/>important finding since the Transfer of Innovation of the Allergy Diary is an EIP on AHA scaling up <lb/>project (16). <lb/>One of the major findings of the study is the very similar results with both tools supporting the use of <lb/>the ARIA score to assess AR control using mobile technology. The WPAI-AS scores observed in the <lb/>study are lower than those reported in patients selected by physicians (11, 17-19). This is because <lb/>many users have mild rhinitis whereas in clinical trials or in patients selected by physicians AR is <lb/>usually more severe. <lb/>This study also suggests that, in real life, there is a phenotype of severe AR that needs to be <lb/>considered in terms of public health and cost savings since the severe form causes disability. This <lb/>phenotype is in focus in the Finnish Allergy Program (20). <lb/>Table 1: Mean levels of EQ-5D and WPAI-AS depending on the ARIA score <lb/>EQ-5D VAS <lb/>WPAI-AS Q9 <lb/>N <lb/>m ± sd <lb/>N <lb/>m ± sd <lb/>No rhinitis <lb/>48 <lb/>80.0±19.0 <lb/>49 <lb/>27.5±25.5 <lb/>ARIA score <lb/>0 <lb/>83 <lb/>77.0±21.3 a <lb/>71 <lb/>29.9±27.3 d <lb/>1 <lb/>403 <lb/>79.5±19.1 <lb/>308 <lb/>20.4±22.1 <lb/>2 <lb/>368 <lb/>76.2±20.2 <lb/>268 <lb/>30.1±23.9 <lb/>3 <lb/>199 <lb/>72.6±18.7 b <lb/>164 <lb/>41.4±27.3 <lb/>4 <lb/>186 <lb/>67.7±23.0 c <lb/>168 <lb/>45.8±27.7 e <lb/>p a/b &lt;0.0001, p a/c &lt;0.0001, p d/e &lt;0.0001, Student&apos;s t test <lb/>Accepted Article <lb/>Figure 1: Repartition of users depending <lb/>References <lb/>1.
