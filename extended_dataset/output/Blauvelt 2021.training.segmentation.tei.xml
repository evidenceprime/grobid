Chu, MD; Kilian Eyerich, MD <lb/>IMPORTANCE Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory skin disease with <lb/>an unmet need for treatments that provide rapid and high levels of skin clearance and itch <lb/>improvement. <lb/>OBJECTIVE To assess the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib vs dupilumab in adults with <lb/>moderate-to-severe AD. <lb/>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Heads Up was a 24-week, head-to-head, phase 3b, <lb/>multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled clinical trial <lb/>comparing the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib with dupilumab among 692 adults with <lb/>moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for systemic therapy. The study was conducted <lb/>from February 21, 2019, to December 9, 2020, at 129 centers located in 22 countries across <lb/>Europe, North and South America, Oceania, and the Asia-Pacific region. Efficacy analyses <lb/>were conducted in the intent-to-treat population. <lb/>INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 and treated with oral upadacitinib, 30 mg once <lb/>daily, or subcutaneous dupilumab, 300 mg every other week. <lb/>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was achievement of 75% improvement <lb/>in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) at week 16. Secondary end points were <lb/>percentage change from baseline in the Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (weekly <lb/>average), proportion of patients achieving EASI100 and EASI90 at week 16, percentage change <lb/>from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS at week 4, proportion of patients achieving EASI75 at week <lb/>2, percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) at week 1, and Worst <lb/>Pruritus NRS (weekly average) improvement of 4 points or more at week 16. End points at week <lb/>24 included EASI75, EASI90, EASI100, and improvement of 4 points or more in Worst Pruritus <lb/>NRS from baseline (weekly average). Safety was assessed as treatment-emergent adverse events <lb/>in all patients receiving 1 or more dose of either drug. <lb/>RESULTS Of 924 patients screened, 348 (183 men [52.6%]; mean [SD] age, 36.6 [14.6] years) <lb/>were randomized to receive upadacitinib and 344 were randomized to receive dupilumab <lb/>(194 men [56.4%]; mean [SD] age, 36.9 [14.1] years); demographic and disease characteristics <lb/>were balanced among treatment groups. At week 16, 247 patients receiving upadacitinib <lb/>(71.0%) and 210 patients receiving dupilumab (61.1%) achieved EASI75 (P = .006). All ranked <lb/>secondary end points also demonstrated the superiority of upadacitinib vs dupilumab, <lb/>including improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS as early as week 1 (mean [SE], 31.4% [1.7%] vs <lb/>8.8% [1.8%]; P &lt; .001), achievement of EASI75 as early as week 2 (152 [43.7%] vs 60 [17.4%]; <lb/>P &lt; .001), and achievement of EASI100 at week 16 (97 [27.9%] vs 26 [7.6%]; P &lt; .001). Rates <lb/>of serious infection, eczema herpeticum, herpes zoster, and laboratory-related adverse <lb/>events were higher for patients who received upadacitinib, whereas rates of conjunctivitis <lb/>and injection-site reactions were higher for patients who received dupilumab. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE During 16 weeks of treatment, upadacitinib demonstrated <lb/>superior efficacy vs dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, with no new safety <lb/>signals. <lb/>TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03738397 <lb/>JAMA Dermatol. 2021;157(9):1047-1055. doi:10.1001/jamadermatol.2021.3023 <lb/>Published online August 4, 2021.

			<body>A <lb/>topic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by a chronic and <lb/>relapsing nature, eczematous morphology, and intense <lb/>pruritus. 1,2 It is driven by proinflammatory mediators, <lb/>such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-13, IL-22, IL-31, interferon gamma <lb/>(IFN-γ), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), that trans-<lb/>duce signals via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activa-<lb/>tor of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway. 3,4 Dupilumab, <lb/>a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the shared <lb/>IL-4 receptor subunit α of IL-4 and IL-13 receptors, is approved <lb/>for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD; however, fewer than <lb/>half of patients achieve clear or almost clear skin after 16 weeks <lb/>of dupilumab monotherapy, with maximal responses achieved <lb/>after week 12. 5 Thus, there is a need for additional treatment <lb/>options that provide improved clinical responses to a greater <lb/>proportion of patients and in a more rapid manner. <lb/>Upadacitinib is an oral, reversible, small molecule JAK in-<lb/>hibitor engineered to have increased selectivity for JAK1 vs JAK2, <lb/>JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2, with the intention of improving ef-<lb/>ficacy and safety for an improved benefit-risk profile compared <lb/>with other, less-selective JAK inhibitors. 6 Upadacitinib is ap-<lb/>proved in the United States, European Union, and other coun-<lb/>tries to treat moderately or severely active rheumatoid arthri-<lb/>tis, and is being developed for the treatment of AD and other <lb/>immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. 6 Results from 1 phase <lb/>2b 7 and 3 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials (Measure Up 1, Measure <lb/>Up 2, and AD Up) 8,9 demonstrated that once-daily upadacitinib <lb/>(15 or 30 mg) is a well-tolerated and effective treatment option <lb/>for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Here, we assess the <lb/>safety and efficacy of upadacitinib vs dupilumab in adults with <lb/>moderate-to-severe AD. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Study Design <lb/>Heads Up (NCT03738397) was a 24-week, head-to-head, phase <lb/>3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy, <lb/>active-controlled clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy <lb/>of upadacitinib with dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-<lb/>severe AD. This clinical trial was conducted from February 21, <lb/>2019, to December 9, 2020, at 129 centers located in 22 countries <lb/>across Europe, North and South America, Oceania, and the Asia-<lb/>Pacific region. Heads Up had a 35-day screening period, a 24-<lb/>week double-blinded treatment period, and a 12-week follow-up <lb/>visit or the option to enter an open-label upadacitinib extension <lb/>study. Independent ethics committees or institutional review <lb/>boards approved the trial protocol, informed consent form(s), <lb/>and recruitment materials before patient enrollment. This clinical <lb/>trial was conducted in accord with the International Conference <lb/>for Harmonisation guidelines, applicable regulations, and the <lb/>Declaration of Helsinki. 10 Patients provided written informed <lb/>consent before screening. This study followed the Consolidated <lb/>Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline (trial protocol <lb/>in Supplement 1). <lb/>Patients <lb/>Eligible patients were adults aged 18 to 75 years with diag-<lb/>nosed AD using the Hanifin and Rajka criteria 11 who were can-<lb/>didates for systemic therapy (inadequate response to topical <lb/>treatments for AD, documented use of systemic treatment for <lb/>AD, or topical treatments for AD otherwise medically inadvis-<lb/>able) and who had moderate-to-severe disease (defined as <lb/>≥10% of body surface area affected by AD, Eczema Area and <lb/>Severity Index [EASI] ≥16, validated Investigator&apos;s Global As-<lb/>sessment for AD score ≥3 at screening and baseline visits, and <lb/>weekly average Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] <lb/>score ≥4 at baseline). Prior use of JAK inhibitors or dupil-<lb/>umab was prohibited. eTable 1 in Supplement 2 has complete <lb/>patient eligibility criteria. <lb/>Clinical Trial Procedures <lb/>Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 30 mg of upadaci-<lb/>tinib via extended-release tablet administered orally once <lb/>daily until week 24 or 300 mg of dupilumab administered as <lb/>a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks after a loading dose <lb/>of 600 mg, starting at week 2 and until week 22 (eFigure 1 in <lb/>Supplement 2). Rescue therapy, defined as any topical or <lb/>systemic immunomodulatory treatment initiated for AD, <lb/>could be given at any time per investigator discretion. <lb/>Patients who received rescue therapy were considered non-<lb/>responders for binary end points after the initiation of <lb/>rescue therapy. <lb/>Efficacy Parameters <lb/>Efficacy was assessed as upadacitinib superiority compared <lb/>with dupilumab, with the primary end point being 75% im-<lb/>provement in EASI (EASI75) at week 16. Ranked secondary end <lb/>points were: percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruri-<lb/>tus NRS, achievement of EASI100 and EASI90 at week 16, per-<lb/>centage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS at week <lb/>4, achievement of EASI75 at week 2, percentage change from <lb/>baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS at week 1, and Worst Pruritus <lb/>NRS improvement of 4 points or more at week 16. Additional <lb/>unranked end points were assessed at week 24, including <lb/>achievement of EASI75, EASI90, and EASI100, as well as im-<lb/>provement of 4 points or more in Worst Pruritus NRS. The Worst <lb/>Pruritus NRS end points were based on weekly averages of daily <lb/>pruritus scores. Dermatology Life Quality Index and Patient-<lb/>Oriented Eczema Measure data were not collected after base-<lb/>line in this study. <lb/>Key Points <lb/>Question Are the efficacy and safety of oral upadacitinib superior <lb/>to subcutaneous dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe <lb/>atopic dermatitis (AD)? <lb/>Findings This randomized, blinded, head-to-head comparator <lb/>clinical trial of 692 patients with moderate-to-severe AD <lb/>demonstrated clinically meaningful skin clearance and itch relief, <lb/>with statistically significant superiority for upadacitinib compared <lb/>with dupilumab. There were no new safety signals reported for <lb/>either upadacitinib or dupilumab. <lb/>Meaning Upadacitinib provides superior and more rapid skin <lb/>clearance and itch relief with tolerable safety compared with <lb/>dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. <lb/></body>

			<body>Safety Parameters <lb/>Safety was assessed as treatment-emergent adverse events <lb/>(TEAEs) in all patients who received 1 or more dose of study <lb/>drug through follow-up (30 days after the last dose of upa-<lb/>dacitinib or 84 days after the last dose of dupilumab); a TEAE <lb/>was defined as any adverse event (AE) that began or worsened <lb/>in severity after initiation of upadacitinib or dupilumab. All <lb/>AEs presented were treatment-emergent, unless otherwise <lb/>noted. <lb/>Statistical Analysis <lb/>Statistical analysis was conducted on an intent-to-treat basis. <lb/>The primary approach for evaluating categorical end points was <lb/>NRI-C (Nonresponder Imputation incorporating Multiple Im-<lb/>putation [MI] to handle missing data due to COVID-19). The <lb/>initial NRI approach was revised to NRI-C because of the <lb/>COVID-19 pandemic, which may have prevented visits owing <lb/>to logistical restrictions; additional details regarding the NRI-C <lb/>approach are outlined in the eMethods in Supplement 2. Mul-<lb/>tiplicity-adjusted results were obtained via a hierarchical test-<lb/>ing procedure, controlling the overall type I error rate of all pri-<lb/>mary and ranked secondary end points at the 2-sided 0.05 level <lb/>(eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). <lb/>Results <lb/>Patient Disposition <lb/>A total of 924 patients were screened, of whom 232 were ex-<lb/>cluded and 692 were enrolled and treated; 348 (183 men [52.6%]; <lb/>mean [SD] age, 36.6 [14.6] years) received upadacitinib, and 344 <lb/>(194 men [56.4%]; mean [SD] age, 36.9 [14.1] years) received du-<lb/>pilumab. The number of patients who discontinued treatment <lb/>was low overall; 316 (90.8%) completed upadacitinib treat-<lb/>ment, and 319 (92.7%) completed dupilumab treatment <lb/>(Figure 1); 336 patients (96.6%) completed 16 weeks of upadaci-<lb/>tinib treatment, and 328 patients (95.3%) completed 16 weeks <lb/>of dupilumab treatment. Eighty-seven upadacitinib-treated pa-<lb/>tients (25.0%) and 85 dupilumab-treated patients (24.7%) re-<lb/>ceived rescue therapy and were considered nonresponders for <lb/>visits after receiving rescue therapy. <lb/>Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced <lb/>among the upadacitinib-treated and dupilumab-treated <lb/>groups, including key measures of disease activity: mean (SD) <lb/>EASI (30.8 [12.5] and 28.8 [11.5], respectively) and proportion <lb/>of patients with severe validated Investigator&apos;s Global Assess-<lb/>ment for AD (174 [50.0%] and 173 [50.3%], respectively) <lb/>(Table 1). <lb/>Efficacy Outcomes <lb/>The proportion of patients who achieved EASI75 at week 16 <lb/>was significantly greater for patients receiving upadacitinib <lb/>than those receiving dupilumab (247 [71.0%] vs 210 [61.1%]; <lb/>adjusted difference, 10.0% (95% CI, 2.9%-17.0%; P = .006) <lb/>(Table 2), thereby meeting the primary end point of EASI75 at <lb/>week 16 for superiority of upadacitinib compared with dupil-<lb/>umab. The response rate was calculated using the NRI-C <lb/>approach. The results based on NRI-C were consistent with <lb/>those based on NRI-NC (the traditional NRI approach), given <lb/>that the number of patients with missing values owing to <lb/>COVID-19 for the primary end point was low (1.6% [11 of 692]) <lb/>(eTables 2 and 3 in Supplement 2). Most patients in both <lb/>treatment groups did not receive rescue therapy (eTable 4 in <lb/>Supplement 2). <lb/>Onset of action was more rapid for upadacitinib, with the <lb/>proportion of patients achieving EASI75 at week 2 signifi-<lb/>cantly greater for those receiving upadacitinib compared with <lb/>those receiving dupilumab (152 of 348 [43.7%] vs 60 of 344 <lb/>[17.4%]; P &lt; .001) (Table 2). Significantly greater proportions <lb/>of patients achieved high levels of efficacy (EASI90 and <lb/>EASI100) at week 16 with upadacitinib compared with dupi-<lb/>lumab (EASI90, 211 [60.6%] vs 133 [38.7%]; P &lt; .001; EASI100, <lb/>97 [27.9%] vs 26 [7.6%]; P &lt; .001). The mean (SD) percentage <lb/>improvement from baseline Worst Pruritus NRS was signifi-<lb/>cantly greater for upadacitinib-treated patients compared with <lb/>dupilumab-treated patients as early as week 1 (31.4% [1.7%] vs <lb/>8.8% [1.8%]; P &lt; .001) and week 4 (59.5% [2.2%] vs 31.7% <lb/>[2.2%]; P &lt; .001), and significant differences were main-<lb/>tained through week 16 (66.9% [1.9%] vs 49.0% [2.0%]; <lb/>P &lt; .001).

			<body>NRS improvement ≥4 points from baseline) at week 16 was <lb/>higher for those who received upadacitinib compared with <lb/>those who received dupilumab (188 of 340 [55.3%] vs 120 of <lb/>336 [35.7%]; P &lt; .001). Thus, the study met all ranked sec-<lb/>ondary efficacy end points, demonstrating that upadaci-<lb/>tinib achieved significantly greater improvements in both <lb/>investigator-and patient-reported outcomes compared with <lb/>dupilumab. <lb/>Numerically greater proportions of upadacitinib-treated vs <lb/>dupilumab-treated patients achieved EASI75 as early as week 1 <lb/>(55 of 348 [15.9%] vs 19 of 344 [5.5%]) and at week 4 (243 of 348 <lb/>[69.9%] vs 123 of 344 [35.9%]) (Figure 2A). Similar differences <lb/>were observed for achievement of EASI90 at week 2 (64 of 348 <lb/>[18.5%] vs 20 of 344 [5.8%]) and week 8 (206 of 48 [59.2%] vs 86 <lb/>of 344 [25.1%]) (Figure 2B). Positive differences between propor-<lb/>tions of upadacitinib-treated vs dupilumab-treated patients for <lb/>achievement of EASI100 were also observed at week 4 (29 of 348 <lb/>[8.3%] vs 6 of 344 [1.7%]) and maintained through week 16 (97 <lb/>of 348 [27.9%] vs 26 of 344 [7.6%]) (Figure 2C). In addition, <lb/>upadacitinib-treated patients had significantly greater reductions <lb/>than dupilumab-treated patients in mean (SE) Worst Pruritus NRS <lb/>as early as week 1 (−31.4% [1.7%] vs −8.8% [1.8%]) and maintained <lb/>through week 16 (−66.9% [1.9%] vs −49.0% [2.0%]) (Figure 2D). <lb/>A greater proportion of upadacitinib-treated than dupilumab-<lb/>treated patients achieved EASI75 (223 of 348 [64.2%] vs 205 of <lb/>344 [59.5%]; P = .21 for upadacitinib vs dupilumab without ad-<lb/>justment for multiplicity) at week 24 (eTable 5 in Supplement 2). <lb/>In addition, EASI90 was achieved at week 24 by 194 of 348 <lb/>upadacitinib-treated patients (55.6%) and EASI100 was achieved <lb/>at week 24 by 95 of 348 upadacitinib-treated patients (27.3%), <lb/>while EASI90 was achieved at week 24 by 164 of 344 dupilumab-<lb/>treated patients (47.6%; P = .04 for upadacitinib vs dupilumab <lb/>without adjustment for multiplicity) and EASI100 was achieved <lb/>at week 24 by 45 of 344 dupilumab-treated patients (13.1%; P &lt; <lb/>.001 for upadacitinib vs dupilumab without adjustment for mul-<lb/>tiplicity). Upadacitinib-treated patients also had greater improve-<lb/>ment from baseline in mean (SD) Worst Pruritus NRS than <lb/>dupilumab-treated patients at week 24 (63.1% [2.7%] vs 54.7% <lb/>[2.8%]; P = .03 for upadacitinib vs dupilumab without adjustment <lb/>for multiplicity). <lb/>Safety Outcomes <lb/>The safety profile of upadacitinib in this study was consistent <lb/>with that observed in 1 phase 2b 7 and 3 pivotal phase 3 clini-<lb/>cal trials (Measure Up 1, Measure Up 2, and AD Up) 8,9 (Table 3). <lb/>No new safety risks of upadacitinib were observed in this AD <lb/>study compared with other AD studies. The 16-week inci-<lb/>dence rates of TEAEs were 71.6% in upadacitinib-treated pa-<lb/>tients (249 of 348) and 62.8% in dupilumab-treated patients <lb/>(216 of 344). The rates of serious TEAEs and AEs leading to <lb/>study drug discontinuation were 2.9% (10 of 348) and 2.0% (7 <lb/>of 348) for upadacitinib and 1.2% (4 of 344) and 1.2% (4 of 344) <lb/>for dupilumab, respectively. One death due to influenza-<lb/>associated bronchopneumonia was reported in a 40-year-old <lb/>upadacitinib-treated patient. <lb/>Through 16 weeks of treatment, the most frequently re-<lb/>ported AE among patients treated with upadacitinib was acne <lb/>(55 [15.8%]), whereas acne was reported by 9 patients treated <lb/>with dupilumab (2.6%) (Table 3). All acne events were mild or <lb/>moderate in severity, primarily involved the face and trunk, and <lb/>did not result in scarring; none led to study drug discontinua-<lb/>tion. The most frequently reported AE among patients treated <lb/>with dupilumab was conjunctivitis (29 [8.4%]), whereas con-<lb/>junctivitis was reported by 5 patients treated with upadacitinib <lb/>(1.4%). All conjunctivitis cases were mild or moderate in sever-<lb/>ity, and none led to study drug discontinuation. <lb/>Among AEs of special interest, rates of serious infection (4 <lb/>[1.1%] vs 2 [0.6%]), eczema herpeticum (1 [0.3%] vs 0%), and her-<lb/>pes zoster (7 [2.0%] vs 3 [0.9%]) were numerically higher for pa-<lb/>tients treated with upadacitinib than those treated with <lb/>dupilumab, all at generally low levels (Table 3). Each of the se-<lb/>rious infections was reported in a single patient. No eczema her-<lb/>peticum or herpes zoster event was considered to be serious. All <lb/>herpes zoster events were mild or moderate in severity, and none <lb/>led to study drug discontinuation. Most herpes zoster events in-<lb/>volved a single dermatome; 2 herpes zoster events involved 3 <lb/>or more dermatomes, and 1 had ophthalmic involvement (peri-<lb/>orbital skin) in the upadacitinib group. <lb/>The rate of hepatic disorders was higher among patients <lb/>treated with upadacitinib than those treated with dupil-<lb/>umab (10 [2.9%] vs 4 [1.2%]) (Table 3). Most of the hepatic <lb/>disorders were transaminase elevations that were mild or <lb/>moderate in severity, transient, and reported as singular <lb/>Table 1.

Rates of anemia (7 [2.0%] <lb/>vs 1 [0.3%]), neutropenia (6 [1.7%] vs 2 [0.6%]), and creati-<lb/>nine phosphokinase elevations (23 [6.6%] vs 10 [2.9%]) <lb/>were higher for patients treated with upadacitinib than <lb/>those treated with dupilumab, respectively. There was a <lb/>single event of thrombocytopenia (grade 1 in severity) <lb/>reported in a patient treated with upadacitinib. Most of <lb/>these laboratory test-related AEs were mild or moderate in <lb/>severity, transient, and reported as singular abnormalities <lb/>without recurrence, with only 1 event deemed serious (de-<lb/>creased hemoglobin reported in the dupilumab-treated <lb/>group); none of these events led to study drug discontinua-<lb/>tion. No drug-induced liver injury or rhabdomyolysis events <lb/>were reported. <lb/>One case of malignant neoplasm was reported in each <lb/>treatment group: 1 breast carcinoma in a 68-year-old <lb/>upadacitinib-treated patient (after week 16; eTable 6 in <lb/>Supplement 2) and 1 keratoacanthoma in a 69-year-old <lb/>dupilumab-treated patient. No cases of adjudicated venous <lb/>thromboembolic events, major adverse cardiovascular <lb/>events, active tuberculosis, or gastrointestinal perforation <lb/>were reported in either treatment group. Safety data through <lb/>the end of the monitoring period are summarized in eTable 6 <lb/>in Supplement 2. <lb/>Five nonserious cases of COVID-19 were reported during <lb/>the study-4 in the upadacitinib group and 1 in the dupil-<lb/>umab group. Treatment was temporarily interrupted for 3 upa-<lb/>dacitinib patients and resumed after resolution of the infec-<lb/>tion. Treatment was not interrupted for the fourth upadacitinib <lb/>patient or the dupilumab patient. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>To our knowledge, Heads Up is the first study directly com-<lb/>paring upadacitinib with dupilumab for AD and is now the <lb/>sixth clinical trial examining upadacitinib for the indication. <lb/>This study met the primary end point of EASI75 at week 16 <lb/>and all ranked secondary end points, demonstrating superi-<lb/>ority of upadacitinib vs dupilumab for the treatment of <lb/>adults with moderate-to-severe AD. The most significant dif-<lb/>ferences between upadacitinib and dupilumab were in the <lb/>rapidity of onset and the ability to better achieve high levels <lb/>of skin clearance (eg, EASI90 and EASI100). At week 24, <lb/>upadacitinib-treated patients continued to show numerically <lb/>better results compared with dupilumab-treated patients for <lb/>measures of skin clearance and itch relief. Upadacitinib was <lb/>generally safe and well tolerated with no new safety risks <lb/>observed. <lb/>Despite the approval of dupilumab in recent years, there <lb/>remains an unmet need for therapies that provide better effi-<lb/>cacy outcomes, such as clear or almost clear skin, for <lb/>patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Achievement of <lb/>higher levels of efficacy in AD is associated with greater <lb/>improvements in health-related quality of life. 12 The rela-<lb/>tively high proportions of patients treated with upadacitinib <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>achieving EASI90 and EASI100 at week 16, reported here <lb/>and elsewhere, 7-9 may become important regarding future <lb/>AD treatment goals. A similar shift has occurred in recent <lb/>years with the treatment of patients with another chronic <lb/>inflammatory skin disease, psoriasis, where treatment suc-<lb/>cess shifted from 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and <lb/>Severity Index to 90% and 100% improvement (PASI90 and <lb/>PASI100, respectively). As the effectiveness of new drugs for <lb/>psoriasis have improved, the higher relative improvement <lb/>scores PASI90 and PASI100 have become the benchmark for <lb/>systemic therapies, and we expect to see a similar trend in <lb/>AD treatment benchmarks. <lb/>Treatment effect (including skin and itch improvement) <lb/>was also experienced more rapidly with upadacitinib com-<lb/>pared with dupilumab. Statistically significant skin improve-<lb/>ment as measured by EASI75 was attained as early as week 2 <lb/>with upadacitinib, and significantly higher rates of clinically <lb/>meaningful improvements in itch were reported as early as <lb/>week 1. It is well established that patients prefer treatments <lb/>with a rapid onset of action. 13-15 Upadacitinib-treated patients <lb/>achieved significantly higher rates of the stringent skin <lb/>improvement thresholds EASI90 and EASI100 compared with <lb/>dupilumab. <lb/>Several key inflammatory cytokines are involved in the <lb/>pathogenesis of AD signal via JAK1, including IL-4 and IL-13 <lb/>(epidermal barrier dysfunction), IL-22 (epidermal hyperpro-<lb/>liferation), IL-31 (itch neuron stimulation), IFN-γ (lesion chro-<lb/>nicity), and TSLP (T H 2 cell differentiation). 3,4,16 Dupilumab tar-<lb/>gets the shared IL-4 and IL-13 receptor. By selectively inhibiting <lb/>JAK1, upadacitinib abrogates the signaling of a wider range of <lb/>proinflammatory mediators, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, IL-<lb/>31, IFN-γ, and TSLP. The simultaneous inhibition of multiple <lb/>pathways may contribute to the efficacy and rapidity effects <lb/>of upadacitinib compared with dupilumab. <lb/>The safety profile of upadacitinib in this study was con-<lb/>sistent with that noted in 1 phase 2b trial 7 and 3 pivotal <lb/>phase 3 clinical trials (Measure Up 1, Measure Up 2, and AD <lb/>Up), 8,9 with no new safety risks observed.

			<body>vious studies of JAK inhibitors in patients with rheumatoid <lb/>arthritis, higher rates of acne were reported in studies of upa-<lb/>dacitinib in patients with AD. Of note, acne has also been <lb/>among the most frequently reported TEAEs for other JAK <lb/>inhibitors in AD (abrocitinib and baricitinib); the mechanism <lb/>underlying this AE is unclear. 17-19 The rate of study drug dis-<lb/>continuation secondary to AEs was numerically higher with <lb/>upadacitinib. Rates of serious infection, eczema herpeticum, <lb/>herpes zoster, and laboratory test-related AEs were numeri-<lb/>cally higher with upadacitinib, while the rates of conjunc-<lb/>tivitis and injection-site reactions were numerically higher <lb/>with dupilumab. No venous thromboembolic events, major <lb/>adverse cardiovascular events, or gastrointestinal perfora-<lb/>tions were reported with either treatment. Overall, these <lb/>observations were consistent with the known safety profile <lb/>of each drug. <lb/>Limitations <lb/>This study has some limitations. The data reported here are <lb/>results through 24 weeks of treatment, with primary and <lb/>ranked secondary end points at week 16. Longer-term data are <lb/>being collected in a separate open-label extension study. Al-<lb/>though not necessarily a limitation, this study evaluated both <lb/>upadacitinib and dupilumab as monotherapy treatments, and <lb/>patients who received any topical agent as rescue therapy were <lb/>treated as nonresponders after receipt of rescue therapy. In real-<lb/>world practice, many patients use systemic therapies in com-<lb/>bination with topical therapies 20 ; concomitant use of topical <lb/>corticosteroids is addressed in a separate study of upadaci-<lb/>tinib for AD. 9 <lb/>To maintain blinding, the monotherapy treatments of oral <lb/>upadacitinib and subcutaneous dupilumab were each accom-<lb/>panied by a placebo for the opposite therapy, but there was no <lb/>comparison against placebo as tested in the pivotal studies of <lb/>these treatments. When dupilumab, 300 mg every 2 weeks, <lb/>was given as monotherapy in SOLO1 and SOLO2, 51% and 44% <lb/>of patients, respectively, achieved EASI75 at week 16 when <lb/>compared with 15% and 12% for placebo, respectively. 5 Higher <lb/>response rates for dupilumab may have been observed in the <lb/>present study owing to the lack of a placebo comparator and <lb/>subsequent responder or efficacy assessor bias. However, this <lb/>potential bias did not seem to impact response rates in the upa-<lb/>dacitinib group; in the upadacitinib placebo-controlled mono-<lb/>therapy studies, Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2, 79.7% and <lb/>72.9% of patients treated with upadacitinib, 30 mg once daily, <lb/>achieved EASI75 at week 16, respectively, compared with 16.3% <lb/>and 13.3% for placebo, respectively. 8 <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Overall, upadacitinib was well tolerated and provided supe-<lb/>rior efficacy compared with dupilumab after 16 weeks of treat-<lb/>ment in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Upadacitinib <lb/>achieved higher levels of skin clearance and itch relief with a <lb/>more rapid onset of action vs dupilumab. Upadacitinib is an <lb/>effective treatment option for patients with moderate-to-<lb/>severe AD and may help inform future treatment decisions. <lb/>Table 3.
