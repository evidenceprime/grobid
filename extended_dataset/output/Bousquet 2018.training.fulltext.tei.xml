			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Measures of allergic rhinitis (AR) control include symptom scores, patients&apos; self-administered visual<lb/> analogue scales (VAS), objective measures of nasal obstruction, a recent modification of the ARIA<lb/> severity classification, or patients&apos; reported outcomes such as QOL or scores with several items <ref type="biblio">(1, 2)</ref>.<lb/> Mobile technology has been used to appraise AR control <ref type="biblio">(3, 4</ref>). More information is however needed<lb/> to fully understand the importance of these novel approaches.<lb/></p>

			<p>MASK-rhinitis (MACVIA-ARIA Sentinel NetworK for allergic rhinitis), an ICT system centred<lb/> around the patient <ref type="biblio">(5)</ref>, is one of the implementation tools of the B3 Action Plan of the European<lb/> Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP on AHA) (6). A mobile phone app<lb/> (Allergy Diary) central to MASK-rhinitis belongs to the Fondation Partenariale FMC VIA-LR<lb/> (Ministry of Education and Research, France). App users are asked to complete a short demographic<lb/> questionnaire, EQ-5D (7-10) and WPAI-AS <ref type="biblio">(11, 12)</ref>, thus providing baseline characteristics of their<lb/> disease. The Allergy Diary has been launched in 21 countries <ref type="biblio">(3, 4)</ref>. It was found to be an easy and<lb/> effective method of assessing symptoms of AR and work productivity. The ARIA score is also<lb/> available in the Allergy Diary adding the four components of the impact of AR (sleep, work and<lb/> school performance, daily activities and bothersome symptoms).<lb/></p>

			<p>The ARIA score of the Allergy Diary was compared with QOL scores of EQ-5D (7-10) and WPAI-<lb/>AS <ref type="biblio">(11, 12)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/> Design of the study<lb/></head>

			<p>A cross-sectional study on a self-selected population was carried out from June 1, 2016 to June 1,<lb/> 2017. EQ-5D (7-10) and/or WPAI-AS <ref type="biblio">(11, 12)</ref> questionnaires are only available in some countries<lb/> and not all of the Allergy Diary users filled in these questionnaires as they are optional. All users<lb/> filled in the ARIA score. The ARIA score was compared with the EQ-5D visual analogue scale<lb/> (VAS) and Question 9 (degree allergy affected regular activities) of the WPAI-AS.<lb/></p>

			<p>The study is reported according to STROBE.<lb/></p>

			<head>Setting and users<lb/></head>

			<p>All consecutive users from June 1, 2016 to June 1, 2017 who answered the questions of the EQ-5D<lb/> (7-10) and/or WPAI-AS <ref type="biblio">(11, 12)</ref> were included in the study in 18 countries. Some demographic<lb/> characteristics (age, sex, country and language) were recorded. The App was used by people who<lb/> found it on Internet, Apple App store, Google Play store or any other way. A few users were clinic<lb/> patients that were asked by their physicians to use the app. However, due to anonymisation of data, no<lb/> specific information was gathered.<lb/></p>

			<head>Allergy Diary<lb/></head>

			<p>The app collects information on AR symptoms experienced (nasal and ocular), disease type<lb/> (intermittent/persistent), how symptoms impact users&apos; lives, and type(s) of AR treatment used (Table<lb/> <ref type="table">1</ref> online). The system has been deployed in 21 countries and in 16 languages (translated and back-<lb/>translated, culturally adapted and legally compliant).<lb/></p>

			<head>Ethics<lb/></head>

			<p>The Allergy Diary is CE1 registered but not considered by the Ethical Committee of the Cologne<lb/> hospital of the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency -GOV.UK) as a<lb/> medical device as it does not give any recommendations concerning treatment or diagnosis. The terms<lb/> of use, translated into all languages and customized according to each country&apos;s legislation, allow the<lb/> use of the results for research purposes. The data are anonymized except for geolocalized data that<lb/> are never totally anonymous. An Independent Review Board approval was not needed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>The ARIA score was calculated using the four Q4 questions of the Allergy Diary which include<lb/> impact on daily activities, work and sleep and troublesome symptoms (Table <ref type="table">1</ref> online). Each of the 4<lb/> items was ascribed a score of 1 (&quot;Yes&quot;) or 0 (&quot;No&quot;). The total ARIA score ranged from 0 (no<lb/> impairment) to 4 (severe impairment).<lb/></p>

			<p>The electronic form of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (https://euroqol.org) was applied in the 10<lb/> available languages (Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese,<lb/> Spanish) (Online supplement 1) and we assessed the global VAS level and mobility impairment as<lb/> this was an absent domain in the assessment of AR impairment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The electronic form of the WPAI-AS questionnaire was applied in the 10 available languages (same<lb/> as above for EQ-5D) <ref type="biblio">(11, 12)</ref> according to the package obtained from Reilly and associates<lb/> (www.reillyassociates.net/WPAI_General.html). The percentage of impairment due to allergy for<lb/> daily activities (Q9) was the outcome used. (Online supplement 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Classification of users<lb/></head>

			<p>Users with any positive answer to Q4 (Table <ref type="table">1</ref> online) were classified as &quot;rhinitis&quot; (score 0-4). Those<lb/> with a score of zero were classified as &quot;no rhinitis&quot; if they had no symptom (Q3, Table <ref type="table">1</ref></p>

			<head>online).<lb/></head>

			<p>Those with a positive answer were classified as &quot;rhinitis&quot; (score 0).<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical methods and analyses<lb/></head>

			<p>Some users filled in EQ-5D or WPAI-AS more than once for a single day. The first data were then<lb/> used. A non-Gaussian distribution was found for some of the data (Shapiro-Wilk test). However, EQ-<lb/>5D data are usually reported in means and SD. Since the number of observations was large, we used<lb/> parametric analyses.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/> Users<lb/></head>

			<p>Of the 12,179 registered users, 1,287 filled in the EQ-5D questionnaire and 1,028 the WPAI-AS<lb/> questionnaire (Table <ref type="table">2 online</ref>). Among the 843 users who filled in both questionnaires, there were 507<lb/> women (60%) and 336 men (40%), with a mean (± SD) age of 35 ± 14 years.<lb/></p>

			<head>Main results<lb/></head>

			<p>Similar levels of EQ-5D VAS and WPAI-AS Q9 were found for users with no rhinitis and for those<lb/> with an ARIA score of 0 to 2. There was a significant reduction of EQ-5D VAS levels and a<lb/> significant increase of WPAI-AS Q9 levels in users with an ARIA score of 3 or 4 (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The repartition of users for both EQ-5D and WPAI-AS (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) shows that impairment occurred<lb/> significantly more commonly for ARIA scores of 3 and 4 than for ARIA scores of 0-3. There were<lb/> from 12 to 16% of users with an EQ-5D VAS level ≥60 in ARIA scores 0-2 whereas the level<lb/> increased to 26 and 27% in users with an ARIA score of 3 or 4. There were from 19 to 31% of users<lb/> with a Q9 ≥50 in ARIA scores of 0-2 whereas the level increased to 51 and 53% in users with an<lb/> ARIA score of 3 or 4.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>This pilot study using mobile technology showed that QOL data (EQ-5D VAS and WPAI-AS Q9) are<lb/> similar in users without rhinitis as in those with mild rhinitis (scores 0-2). Users with a score of 3 or 4<lb/> had a significant impairment in QOL.<lb/></p>

			<head>Strengths and limitations<lb/></head>

			<p>The strengths and limitations of this study are those of mobile technology lengthily discussed<lb/> previously <ref type="biblio">(3, 4)</ref>. In particular, there is a lack of patient characterization that is impossible using an<lb/> App. However, every observational study we have performed using the Allergy Diary has confirmed<lb/> its interest and was able to identify users with a severe disease. It is likely that mobile technology will<lb/> become a very important tool for the understanding and management of AR.<lb/></p>

			<p>One specific problem of the study is that there are more countries with EQ-5D or WPAI-AS reporting<lb/> than translations in the App. It is not known which translations were employed by users.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this study, we did not perform sub-analyses assessing the importance of symptoms or other factors.<lb/> We did not investigate the treatments received. As this is a pilot study, these analyses will be carried<lb/> out once the number of users will have increased.<lb/></p>

			<head>Generalizability<lb/></head>

			<p>The EQ-5D scores observed in the study accord with those of previous studies <ref type="biblio">(8, 10)</ref>. Users with an<lb/> ARIA score of 3 to 4 have a level similar to asthmatic patients with uncontrolled asthma <ref type="biblio">(13, 14)</ref>.<lb/> Because of the equal weighing score of ARIA, it is difficult to know whether these differences may be<lb/> due to specific symptoms (e.g. sleep). EQ-5D is a MAFEIP (Monitoring and assessment framework<lb/> for the EIP on AHA) tool <ref type="biblio">(15)</ref> and the present study is in line with the EIP on AHA. This is another<lb/> important finding since the Transfer of Innovation of the Allergy Diary is an EIP on AHA scaling up<lb/> project <ref type="biblio">(16)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>One of the major findings of the study is the very similar results with both tools supporting the use of<lb/> the ARIA score to assess AR control using mobile technology. The WPAI-AS scores observed in the<lb/> study are lower than those reported in patients selected by physicians <ref type="biblio">(11, 17-19)</ref>. This is because<lb/> many users have mild rhinitis whereas in clinical trials or in patients selected by physicians AR is<lb/> usually more severe.<lb/></p>

			<p>This study also suggests that, in real life, there is a phenotype of severe AR that needs to be<lb/> considered in terms of public health and cost savings since the severe form causes disability. This<lb/> phenotype is in focus in the Finnish Allergy Program <ref type="biblio">(20)</ref>.<lb/></p>
