			<head>Background<lb/></head>

			<p>Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is a common inflammatory<lb/> disorder affecting the nasal membranes characterised<lb/> by symptoms such as sneezing and nasal congestion.<lb/> It is a global health problem; conservative estimates<lb/> suggest that approximately 500 million people worldwide<lb/> are affected by the disease. The burden of AR is often<lb/> under-estimated since the disease is not life-threatening.<lb/> However, it can cause significant morbidity, through<lb/> both the physical symptoms and its impact on quality of<lb/> life and well-being <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. It has a profound effect on many<lb/> aspects of daily life such as sleep <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>, work/school <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>,<lb/> and social life, having been shown to result in fatigue and<lb/> mood changes <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>, to impair cognitive function <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>, and<lb/> to lead to depression and anxiety <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Large scale multinational studies that have collected data<lb/> on the prevalence of AR in adults are rare and those that<lb/> have taken place use different study methodologies and<lb/> case definitions, and report a wide range of prevalence<lb/> estimates. Several studies have been conducted in Western<lb/> Europe and the United States (US). For example, one<lb/> study carried out in six European countries (Belgium,<lb/> France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom<lb/> (UK)) using the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on<lb/> Asthma (ARIA) definition of AR reported that overall, the<lb/> prevalence of AR, confirmed by clinical examination was<lb/> 22.7%. However, the prevalence varied between countries<lb/> from 16.9% in Italy to 28.5% in Belgium <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>. Data from<lb/> the Burden of Rhinitis in America study reported the<lb/> prevalence of rhinitis associated with seasonal or perennial<lb/> rhinitis to range between 11.9% and 30.2% depending on<lb/> duration of symptoms and physician diagnosis <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Data on the prevalence and burden of AR outside<lb/> of these areas, and in the Middle East particularly,<lb/> is scarce. Most studies have been carried out among<lb/> school children, many of which have been based<lb/> on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies<lb/> in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaires and a wide<lb/> variation in prevalence has been reported. Differences<lb/> in prevalence have been reported between countries in<lb/> the region and prevalence has also been shown to vary<lb/> between the age groups of the children included in the<lb/> studies. For example, a nationwide survey in Oman<lb/> reported a 7.4% prevalence of AR in 6-7 year olds and<lb/> a 10.5% prevalence in 13-14 year olds, whereas a study<lb/> in Qatar reported a 30.5% prevalence of physician<lb/> diagnosed AR in children between 6 and 14 years old.<lb/> Studies in adults have been carried out in the United<lb/> Arab Emirates (UAE) <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>, and Turkey <ref type="biblio">[10-13]</ref> and the<lb/> Allergies In the Middle East Survey (AIMES) reported<lb/> the prevalence of AR in adults across five Middle Eastern<lb/> countries (Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and the<lb/> UAE). However, once again, these studies use varying<lb/> case definitions and a range of study designs making it<lb/> difficult to compare the results.<lb/></p>

			<p>To address the need for data in the Middle East on the<lb/> prevalence and burden of AR, the SNAPSHOT program<lb/> was conducted; a large, cross-sectional, population-<lb/>based program using a standardised methodology<lb/> in five countries in the region (Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi<lb/> Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE), to investigate the current<lb/> prevalence and disease burden attributable to AR in the<lb/> adult population of these five countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/> The SNAPSHOT Program<lb/></head>

			<p>SNAPSHOT is a multi-national, cross-sectional,<lb/> population-based<lb/> program,<lb/> comprising<lb/> multiple<lb/> studies, conducted in a random sample of the adult<lb/> general population of five countries (Egypt, Kuwait,<lb/> Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE), between July 2014<lb/> and February 2016. The objective of the SNAPSHOT<lb/> program was to provide an omnibus approach to collect<lb/> data simultaneously about multiple diseases using<lb/> a standardised methodology. The program provides<lb/> updated epidemiological data on the prevalence, burden<lb/> of disease, quality of life and healthcare resource use<lb/> related to four chronic diseases in the participating<lb/> countries: asthma, AR, bipolar disorder and benign<lb/> prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The selection of these<lb/> diseases was based on the need to respond to emerging<lb/> health technology assessment (HTA) requirements by<lb/> local authorities in these Middle Eastern countries. The<lb/> complete methodology and program rationale have been<lb/> described in detail elsewhere <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>A quota of 10,000 subjects from the adult general<lb/> population of Turkey and Egypt and 15,000 from the<lb/> Gulf cluster (comprised of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the<lb/> UAE) was targeted based on the demographic structure<lb/> of the country in terms of age and gender, using a<lb/> random stratified sampling method. In the Gulf cluster,<lb/> it was difficult to reach the target sample size, and since<lb/> the combined number of interviews conducted to date<lb/> in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE showed that the<lb/> program objectives could be achieved from a sample size<lb/> perspective, recruitment was stopped in February 2016<lb/> and the database locked on the 11th of April 2016.<lb/></p>

			<p>Subjects first responded to a screening questionnaire<lb/> to identify subjects fulfilling the criteria for each<lb/> of the diseases and record social and demographic<lb/> characteristics, as well as the presence of co-morbidities.<lb/> Respondents who met the criteria for one or more<lb/> diseases were invited to continue the interview by<lb/> replying to a detailed, disease-specific questionnaire. This<lb/> questionnaire collected additional information on burden<lb/> of disease, disease management and healthcare resource<lb/> utilisation. Data on quality of life were also captured using<lb/> the three level EuroQoL Five-Dimension questionnaire<lb/> (EQ-5D-3L) (© EuroQol Research Foundation. EQ-5D ™<lb/> is a trade mark of the EuroQol Research Foundation) <ref type="biblio">[15,<lb/> 16]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Case definition<lb/></head>

			<p>Subjects were screened for AR based on the Score For<lb/> Allergic Rhinitis (SFAR) questionnaire, a validated<lb/> screening tool which consists of 10 items with a score<lb/> ranging from 0 to 16 <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>. The full questionnaire is<lb/> shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, together with the scores attributable<lb/> to each item. A subject who scored a cumulative score<lb/> greater than or equal to seven was classified as having<lb/> AR. The SFAR questionnaire was presented in the<lb/> language of the country where the study took place.<lb/> The translated versions of the SFAR questionnaire in<lb/> all three languages of the SNAPSHOT program were<lb/> provided for use by the author and copyright holder of<lb/> the questionnaire. Validation of the SFAR questionnaire<lb/> can also be found in the literature <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>, and translated<lb/> versions have been previously used in Turkey <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>, and<lb/> the Maghreb <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data collected for this analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>The analysis presented here focuses solely on AR and<lb/> aims to provide estimates of the current prevalence<lb/> of AR and demonstrate the burden of disease in the<lb/> countries studied. AR prevalence data were collected<lb/> using the case definition described and adjusted by<lb/> age, gender and country. Socio-demographic data<lb/> were collected to describe the characteristics of the<lb/> overall program population, including gender and age<lb/> distribution, height and weight (body mass index (BMI)<lb/> was calculated), the presence of co-morbid conditions,<lb/> family history of the disease and smoking status. If a<lb/> respondent was a current or former smoker, they were<lb/> asked to provide the duration and extent of exposure.<lb/> Additionally, the type and frequency of co-morbidities<lb/> was investigated and risk factors for AR were identified.<lb/> As part of the screening questionnaire, subjects were<lb/> also screened for asthma using a case definition based<lb/> on the global Asthma Insights and Reality (AIR)<lb/> surveys <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Table 1 Score For Allergic Rhinitis (SFAR) questionnaire<lb/></head>

			<p>The score for allergic questionnaire, consists of 10 questionnaires, scored as indicated in the table. A subject who scored greater than or equal to seven was classified<lb/> as having allergic rhinitis (AR)<lb/> a Pollen season in the Middle East is defined as April, May, September and October <ref type="biblio">[19]<lb/></ref></p>

			<p>Control of AR was assessed using the Rhinitis<lb/> Control Assessment Test (RCAT), a six item self-report<lb/> questionnaire with responses on a five-point scale <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>.<lb/> Symptom control over the past week was assessed; a<lb/> score ≤ 21 indicates that rhinitis symptoms are not<lb/> well-controlled and a score &gt; 21 indicates that rhinitis<lb/> symptoms are well controlled. Severity of the disease<lb/> was assessed based on the 2008 ARIA classification,<lb/> with symptoms being classed as mild or moderate/<lb/> severe depending on the severity of symptoms and their<lb/> impact on social life and school/work <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The level of daytime sleepiness was measured using<lb/> the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), which is an eight-<lb/>item self-report questionnaire, where respondents are<lb/> asked to rate their usual chance of falling asleep while<lb/> engaged in eight different activities on a four-point<lb/> scale (0-3) <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>. A total score between zero and five<lb/> indicates lower normal daytime sleepiness; between<lb/> six and ten denotes higher normal daytime sleepiness;<lb/> between 11 and 12 indicates mild excessive daytime<lb/> sleepiness; between 13 and 15 indicates moderate<lb/> excessive daytime sleepiness; and between 16 and 24<lb/> indicates excessive daytime sleepiness.<lb/></p>

			<p>Daily activities were assessed using a modified<lb/> version of the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a patient<lb/> reported outcome measure for assessing impairment of<lb/> functioning in three major daily activities (work/school<lb/> life; social life/leisure activities and family life/home<lb/> responsibilities). In this study, the standard response<lb/> options metric was modified to scoring on a 5-point<lb/> Likert scale to accommodate data capture during a<lb/> telephone interview. The response options used were<lb/> &apos;not at all/mildly/moderately/markedly/extremely&apos; .<lb/> During the analysis of the results, a &apos;not at all&apos; was<lb/> classified as &apos;no&apos; and a response of &apos;mildly/moderately/<lb/> markedly/extremely&apos; was classified as &apos;yes&apos; . In this study,<lb/> the timeframe used to assess symptom impact was<lb/> &quot;over the past 12 months&quot;. (The SDS was used with the<lb/> permission of the SDS copyright holder Professor DV<lb/> Sheehan. © <ref type="biblio">Sheehan DV 1996 &amp; 2008 &amp; 2016) [23, 24]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>All subjects were also asked to complete the<lb/> EQ-5D-3L questionnaire to measure quality of life, a<lb/> generic questionnaire designed as a measure of health<lb/> status which aims to capture the impact of a disease<lb/> on physical, mental, and social functioning. The<lb/> questionnaire consists of five dimensions (mobility,<lb/> self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/<lb/> depression) each of which can take one of three<lb/> responses (no problems/moderate problems/extreme<lb/> problems) and a visual analogue rating scale (EQ-VAS)<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[15, 16]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>All questionnaires were used in their validated English,<lb/> Turkish or Arabic versions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>Data are presented as proportions and means with<lb/> standard deviations (SD), and 95% confidence intervals<lb/> (95% CI) were calculated for binomial data. Associations<lb/> between variables were estimated using the χ 2 test and<lb/> the Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate. Two-sided tests<lb/> were used in all cases and a probability threshold of<lb/> 0.05 was considered significant. Multivariate regression<lb/> analysis was performed to identify the risk factors<lb/> associated with AR. In the first step, specified variables<lb/> were evaluated independently in a univariate analysis.<lb/> All variables with a p value &lt; 0.20 <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref> in the univariate<lb/> analysis were entered into the multiple logistic regression<lb/> analysis. Variables were retained in the model using a<lb/> backward selection to identify those associated with<lb/> an increased risk of AR at the probability level of<lb/> 0.05. A final multivariate analysis was performed to<lb/> generate odds ratios. Multivariate regression analysis<lb/> was also performed to assess the relationship between<lb/> co-morbidities and AR independent of age, gender and<lb/> country. All statistical analyses were performed using<lb/> SAS ® Version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, USA).<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/> Study sample<lb/></head>

			<p>A total of 33,486 subjects agreed to participate in the<lb/> program, completed all the screening questionnaires<lb/> and thus constituted the screening population. This<lb/> population was distributed between Egypt (10,014),<lb/> Turkey (10,000) and the Gulf cluster <ref type="biblio">(13,472)</ref>. Of the<lb/> subjects enrolled in the program, 1808 fulfilled the case<lb/> definition for AR and were defined as the AR population.<lb/> This was the population used to calculate the prevalence<lb/> of AR and investigate the risk factors, association with<lb/> co-morbidities and impact on quality of life. Of these<lb/> 1808 subjects, 857 (47.4%) completed the entire detailed<lb/> AR questionnaire and constituted the AR responders<lb/> used to investigate the burden of disease. This included<lb/> an assessment of the severity and control of AR reported<lb/> by the subjects and the impact on activities of daily living,<lb/> quality of life and daytime sleepiness.<lb/></p>

			<p>Selected demographics of the SNAPSHOT population<lb/> and those subjects with AR are shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.<lb/> Demographically, there were few major differences<lb/> between the 857 subjects with AR that completed the<lb/> detailed questionnaire and the 1808 subjects who<lb/> constituted the total AR population. The distribution in<lb/> terms of age, gender, BMI, and smoking status is similar<lb/> between the two populations (overall AR population<lb/> and AR responders). The main difference between these<lb/> two groups appears to be in health system coverage.<lb/> A higher proportion of subjects in the AR responders<lb/> group are covered by social security and a lower<lb/> proportion are uninsured.<lb/></p>

			<head>Current prevalence of allergic rhinitis<lb/></head>

			<p>Overall, the adjusted prevalence of AR in the adult<lb/> general population over 18 years of age in the countries<lb/> studied was 5.6% [95% CI <ref type="biblio">5.3-5.8</ref>]. This ranged from<lb/> 3.6% [95% CI 3.2-4.0] in Egypt, to 6.4% [95% CI 5.9-<lb/>6.9] in Turkey and 6.4% [95% CI 6.0-6.9] in the Gulf<lb/> cluster. After adjusting for age, gender and country<lb/> there is little difference between the crude and adjusted<lb/> prevalence. These results are presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>(p &lt; 0.20) with AR: gender, age, country, health system<lb/> coverage, income, BMI, having asthma or chronic<lb/> obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and having a<lb/> family history of AR. When these variables were entered<lb/> into the multivariate analysis, a significant association<lb/> was found between living in the Gulf cluster or Turkey<lb/> and a higher risk of AR (odds ratio (OR) 2.1 and 2.0<lb/> respectively) compared to living in Egypt (p &lt; 0.0001).<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, a significant association (p &lt; 0.0001) was<lb/> observed between having asthma and a higher risk of AR<lb/> (OR 6.6; 95% CI 5.8-7.5). Income was also shown to play<lb/> a role; subjects with an income above the minimum wage<lb/> were associated with a higher risk of AR (OR 1.4; 95% CI<lb/> 1.2-1.5) compared to those with an income lower than<lb/> the minimum wage. In addition, men were shown to have<lb/> a lower risk of AR compared to women (OR 0.5; 95% CI<lb/> 0.4-0.5) (p &lt; 0.0001). These results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The following co-morbidities were found to have a<lb/> significant association (p &lt; 0.20) with AR in a univariate<lb/> analysis: cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immunological,<lb/> neurological, nervous, renal, respiratory, rheumatological<lb/> diseases, diabetes and malignancy. These co-morbidities<lb/> were entered into a multivariate analysis to investigate<lb/> the relationship with AR, adjusting for age, gender and<lb/> country. The co-morbidity with the highest impact was<lb/> respiratory disease (OR 6.4). Detailed investigation<lb/> into the conditions classified under the co-morbidity<lb/> &apos;respiratory disease&apos; revealed that this refers primarily to<lb/> COPD. This was followed by nervous disease (OR 2.0),<lb/> gastrointestinal disease (OR 1.9), cardiovascular disease<lb/> (OR 1.7), rheumatological disease (OR 1.5), and diabetes<lb/> (OR 1.3).

			<p>More than half the subjects with AR had moderate/<lb/> severe disease (55.9%) as defined by the ARIA<lb/> classification. However, the majority (67.0%) reported<lb/> their symptoms as well-controlled (RCAT ≥ 21) and<lb/> most (59.3%) reported low levels of daytime sleepiness<lb/> (ESS 0-5). At a country level, significantly more patients<lb/> reported mild disease in Turkey (59%; n = 282) compared<lb/> to Egypt (23.4%; n = 34) and the Gulf cluster (26.5%;<lb/> n = 62) (p &lt; 0.0001); and Egypt reported a significantly<lb/> lower proportion of subjects with well-controlled<lb/> symptoms (44.4%; n = 52) compared to Turkey (72.1%;<lb/></p>

			<p>Overall, approximately 39% of subjects reported that AR<lb/> symptoms had disrupted their work/school, social/leisure<lb/> and family/home life.

			<head>Impact of allergic rhinitis on quality of life<lb/></head>

			<p>Overall, subjects with AR reported a significantly lower<lb/> (p &lt; 0.0001) mean EQ-5D-3L utility score (0.78 ± 0.32)<lb/> than the general population (0.90 ± 0.21). This<lb/> relationship was observed for all participating countries<lb/> or cluster of countries (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). A similar observation<lb/> was made for the mean EQ-VAS scores; 70.4 ± 20.0 in<lb/> subjects with AR compared to 78.1 ± 17.5 in the general<lb/> population (p &lt; 0.0001).

			<head>Impact of allergic rhinitis control and disease severity<lb/> on quality of life<lb/></head>

			<p>Subjects with AR whose symptoms were well-controlled<lb/> reported a significantly higher EQ-5D-3L utility value<lb/> (0.9 ± 0.2) and EQ-VAS score (73.4 ± 19.3) compared<lb/> to those with symptoms that were not well-controlled<lb/> (0.7 ± 0.4 and 67.1 ± 19.6) (p &lt; 0.0001). This trend<lb/> was the same across each country and the cluster of<lb/> countries studied. Those subjects with moderate/severe<lb/> AR reported significantly lower EQ-5D-3L utility values<lb/> (0.74 ± 0.32) and EQ-VAS scores (68.4 ± 20.6) than<lb/> those with mild disease (0.87 ± 0.24 0 and 74.8 ± 17.8<lb/> respectively) (p &lt; 0.0001).

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>This study reports a considerable burden of disease<lb/> attributable to AR in the five countries studied. Subjects<lb/> with AR reported a significant impact on activities of<lb/> daily living and a negative impact on quality of life,<lb/> both of which were exacerbated in severe or not well-<lb/>controlled subjects. The prevalence of AR was found to<lb/> be relatively low compared to that reported elsewhere.<lb/></p>

			<p>The lower prevalence of AR, compared to figures<lb/> reported in Europe and the US <ref type="biblio">[7, 8]</ref>, could be due to<lb/> many factors, such as cultural differences between the<lb/> countries taking part. In addition, due to environmental<lb/> differences between countries, subjects in the Middle<lb/> East are likely to be exposed to different allergens, which<lb/> may influence the reported prevalence.<lb/></p>

			<p>Overall 1808 subjects screened positively for AR. Of<lb/> the overall AR population, 47.4% (n = 857) completed<lb/> the detailed questionnaire which collected data<lb/> on disease management and were termed the AR<lb/> responders. Demographically, there were few major<lb/> differences between the AR responders and the overall<lb/> AR population. The distribution in terms of age, gender,<lb/> BMI, and smoking status is similar between the two<lb/> populations. However, differences are apparent with<lb/> respect to health system coverage. A higher proportion of<lb/> subjects in the AR responders group are covered by social<lb/> security and a lower proportion are uninsured. This<lb/> difference is probably due to the relative contribution<lb/> of the three countries/cluster involved, which have<lb/> significant differences in terms of the healthcare<lb/> coverage available. In Turkey, most of the population<lb/> (90%) has healthcare coverage through a social security<lb/> system, while in the Gulf cluster healthcare coverage is<lb/> expanding through medical insurance as increasingly<lb/> more individuals receive healthcare in a reimbursed<lb/> manner. In Egypt, for much of the population, healthcare<lb/> is paid by patients out of pocket. The response rate in<lb/> the three countries/cluster differed. There is a higher<lb/> percentage of Turkish subjects in the AR responder<lb/> population (56%) compared to the overall AR population<lb/> (34%), which is reflected in the higher proportion of AR<lb/> responders covered by social security compared to the<lb/> overall AR population. Given the potential impact of this<lb/> on the parameters associated with disease management<lb/> outcomes, such as quality of life, severity and control,<lb/> these results have been presented by country.<lb/></p>

			<p>The SFAR questionnaire is a validated self-report<lb/> measure, which considers most features of the disease<lb/> (clinical symptoms, seasonality, family history, medical<lb/> history and perceived allergy) to screen for AR, and<lb/> is considered to have a higher level of sensitivity and<lb/> specificity than many other questionnaires used to<lb/> screen for the disease, such as that used in the European<lb/> Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECHRS).<lb/> However, it is possible that in this study, the first question<lb/> of the SFAR questionnaire excluded many subjects due to<lb/> unawareness of AR as a disease in the Middle East. Many<lb/> subjects, particularly those with mild symptoms, in the<lb/> absence of a physician diagnosis of AR, might interpret<lb/> their recurrent nasal symptoms as being due to a cold or<lb/> sinus disease and answer no to the first SFAR question<lb/></p>

			<p>and be excluded from the rest of the questionnaire. In line<lb/> with this, almost 60% of AR subjects in SNAPSHOT have<lb/> ARIA defined moderate/severe disease (approximately<lb/> three quarters of subjects in Egypt and the Gulf cluster)<lb/> suggesting that many subjects with mild disease may<lb/> have been missed due to unawareness of the disease. In<lb/> other countries in Europe and North America, where<lb/> the SFAR questionnaire has been used widely, and<lb/> awareness of AR is higher, the first question is necessary<lb/> to eliminate subjects who would otherwise be wrongly<lb/> classified. Moving forward, a modified version of the<lb/> SFAR, may be needed in the Middle East to account for<lb/> the cultural differences in the region and avoid missing<lb/> subjects who would otherwise screen positive for the<lb/> disease. It should also be noted that the SFAR can assess<lb/> AR when the disease is not symptomatic. It is possible to<lb/> reach a score of six or seven points from questions other<lb/> than those on nasal symptoms. Although this does not<lb/> happen frequently, it has been observed and can reduce<lb/> the possibility of misclassification of subjects. Although<lb/> the reported prevalence estimates from SNAPSHOT<lb/> are low, the individuals identified are likely to represent<lb/> the more severe end of the spectrum where the impact<lb/> of AR is greatest and where medical intervention is<lb/> most needed. In addition, some subjects may already be<lb/> taking medications for AR. These subjects may not have<lb/> experienced AR nasal symptoms in the past 12 months<lb/> due to an effective treatment strategy, and therefore<lb/> answered no to question one of the SFAR. Thus,<lb/> although question eight asks about a previous physician<lb/> diagnosis of AR, some subjects with well-treated<lb/> physician diagnosed AR and therefore not experiencing<lb/> bothersome symptoms, may have been excluded from<lb/> the AR population, contributing to the lower prevalence<lb/> estimate observed. Therefore, the estimates provided on<lb/> AR prevalence and its symptoms in the Middle East in the<lb/> SNAPSHOT study can be considered as conservative. For<lb/> future studies on AR in the Middle East, it could be<lb/> considered to first ask questions about the physician<lb/> confirmed AR diagnosis and medication usage since the<lb/> dates of diagnosis, followed up by questions about the AR<lb/> symptoms. This will enable a chronological view of the<lb/> AR diagnosis, disease management, and patient journey<lb/> to be obtained which can help in better understanding<lb/> the level of AR prevalence and symptoms.<lb/> Limited data is available on the prevalence of AR in<lb/> adults across the Middle East, and prevalence estimates<lb/> vary widely both between countries and within countries.<lb/> For example, one study carried out across all seven<lb/> Emirates of the UAE used the ECRHS to screen for AR,<lb/> and reported that at least 7% of the study population<lb/> had the disease <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>. Another study conducted in Al Ain<lb/> city in the UAE used a modified version of the ISAAC<lb/> questionnaire, and reported a much higher prevalence<lb/> at 32% <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>. Many factors are likely to contribute to<lb/> this difference; such as the case definition and study<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Impact of allergic rhinitis on quality of life. Quality of life was assessed using the three level EuroQol Five Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L)<lb/> a EQ-5D-3L utility values for the allergic rhinitis (AR) population and general population by country b EQ-VAS scores for the AR population and<lb/> general population by country. For the AR population (n = 1808) the data represent the mean EQ-5D-3L utility value and EQ-VAS score with the 95%<lb/> CI. For the general population (n = 33,486), the mean EQ-5D-3L utility value and EQ-VAS score is presented. The p values were calculated using the<lb/> Kruskall-Wallis test.

			<p>AIMES is the only multi-country study to have been<lb/> conducted in the Middle East, which was carried out<lb/> in five countries (Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia<lb/> and the UAE) and reported the overall prevalence of<lb/> physician-diagnosed AR to be 10%, ranging from 8%<lb/> in Lebanon to 11% in Egypt <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>. The prevalence of<lb/> AR reported in AIMES is higher than SNAPSHOT,<lb/> however, there were methodological differences in<lb/> this study that may have contributed this finding.<lb/> In AIMES the study was not restricted to adults; all<lb/> subjects ≥ 4 years old were eligible to participate. In<lb/> addition, AIMES used a custom-designed questionnaire<lb/> where a positive screening was based on a physician<lb/> diagnosis of AR and experiencing symptoms and/<lb/> or receiving treatment in the last 12 months. It was<lb/> also mentioned that during the survey other terms<lb/> that could be used to describe AR were also provided<lb/> to the subject, (since it was thought that AR may not<lb/> have been a familiar term in the countries where<lb/> the interviews took place), to ensure that the survey<lb/> captured all subjects with the condition. As already<lb/> discussed, in SNAPSHOT the lack of awareness about<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> Impact of allergic rhinitis control and disease severity on daily life. Impact of allergic rhinitis control and disease severity on activities of daily<lb/> living a impact of disease severity based on the allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma (ARIA) classification on activities of daily living, assessed<lb/> using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) b impact of AR control measured using the Rhinitis Control Assessment Test (RCAT) on activities of daily<lb/> living measured using the SDS. The p values were calculated using the X 2 test<lb/> AR as a condition, may have contributed to the low<lb/> prevalence observed.<lb/></p>

			<p>A variety of studies have been conducted in adults in<lb/> Turkey. Two studies have been conducted using the<lb/> ECRHS questionnaire. In Manisa, the reported AR<lb/> prevalence in adults was 14.5% <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. In a separate study<lb/> in Antalya the reported prevalence was 27.7% <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. The<lb/> Prevalence And Risk Factors of Allergies In Turkey<lb/> (PARFAIT) study investigated the prevalence of AR<lb/> across 14 cities in Turkey and reported the prevalence<lb/> of AR in males to be 11.7% in urban areas and 17.5% in<lb/> rural areas, compared to 17.0% and 21.2% respectively<lb/> for females <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>. Two separate population-based studies<lb/> have been carried out in adults in Turkey, across seven<lb/> geographical regions of the country. One study used<lb/> a custom-designed questionnaire focused mainly on<lb/> descriptive parameters and based the definition of AR on<lb/> the ARIA guidelines. The reported prevalence from this<lb/> study ranged from 16.3% in the Eastern Anatolia region<lb/> to 27.5% in the Marmara region <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>. The second study<lb/> used the SFAR questionnaire and reported an overall self-<lb/>reported prevalence of 29.6% for the whole study group.<lb/> In line with the previous study, the highest prevalence<lb/> of self-reported AR was reported in the Marmara<lb/> region (36.1%) and the lowest was reported in South<lb/> East Anatolia region (21%) <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. The only other study<lb/> in the Middle East which used the SFAR questionnaire<lb/> was carried out in Aydin and reported a 12-month<lb/> prevalence of AR in adults of 14% <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref>. These differences<lb/> in prevalence may be due to many factors, such as<lb/> differences in population selection, the characteristics of<lb/> the population, the period of the year in which the survey<lb/> was conducted or environmental factors. Without a like<lb/> for like comparison of case definition it is difficult to<lb/> compare.<lb/></p>

			<p>Control of AR is essentially seen as absence of<lb/> symptoms and is an important measure which few<lb/> previous studies in the Middle East have addressed.<lb/> The AIMES survey reported that less than half (40%) of<lb/> respondents felt their symptoms were completely or well-<lb/>controlled, and 15% described their symptoms as poorly<lb/> or not controlled, despite the majority taking medication<lb/> to treat their symptoms <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>. In contrast, the majority<lb/> of subjects with AR in the SNAPSHOT program (67%)<lb/> reported their symptoms were controlled. This could be<lb/> due to the different methods used to measure control in<lb/> the two studies, patient perception in the AIMES study<lb/> versus the RCAT in the SNAPSHOT program.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is well established that AR has a profound effect on<lb/> quality of life, having a significant impact on activities<lb/> such as sleep <ref type="biblio">[2, 30]</ref>, work, and social life <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref>. Two-thirds<lb/> of patients who took part in the Allergies in America<lb/> survey, which included 2500 adults aged 18 years or<lb/> older who had been diagnosed with AR, nasal allergies<lb/> or hay fever and were symptomatic or had been treated<lb/> for nasal allergies within the last 12 months reported<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> Impact of allergic rhinitis control on daytime sleepiness. Impact of AR control measured using the Rhinitis Control Assessment Test (RCAT) on<lb/> reported levels of daytime sleepiness, measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The p value was calculated using the X 2 test<lb/> that AR affected their daily life <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>. Regional data from<lb/> the AIMES study reported that 58% of respondents<lb/> felt their daily life was impacted by the disease; 72% of<lb/> respondents reported their performance at work/school<lb/> was affected and 80% reported that AR impacted their<lb/> sleep <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>. The SNAPSHOT results are in line with the<lb/> literature; subjects with AR reported a significant impact<lb/> on quality of life across all countries and the cluster of<lb/> countries studied, which was amplified in more severe<lb/> disease and disease that was not controlled, which is<lb/> also supported in the literature. For example, a French<lb/> study in 3052 patients consulting general practitioners<lb/> for AR investigated the effects of severity and duration<lb/> (intermittent or persistent) of AR on impairment of<lb/> quality of life, sleep and work performance. Disease<lb/> severity had more of an effect than duration and the<lb/> majority (80%) of those with moderate/severe disease<lb/> reported impaired activities, compared to only 40% of<lb/> those with mild symptoms <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The impact of AR on daily activities was assessed using<lb/> the SDS. The SDS was modified for use in this program<lb/> from its usual 0 to 10 point discretized analogue layout<lb/> anchored both numerically, verbally descriptively and<lb/> visually spatially into 5 response option categories (a<lb/> score of 0 = not at all, 1-3 = mildly, 4-6 = moderately,<lb/> 7-9 = markedly, 10 = extremely). Accordingly, data<lb/> analysis was discussed with the scale author to ensure<lb/> correct interpretation of the results. The use of the<lb/> 12-month time frame in this study enables the data to be<lb/> more relevant for governments and healthcare bodies to<lb/> aid in developing healthcare policy. The questionnaire<lb/> has been validated for use in face-to-face interviews, but<lb/> was administered by telephone in SNAPSHOT, which<lb/> should not affect the validity of the data collected.<lb/></p>

			<p>It has frequently been reported that AR results in<lb/> increased daytime sleepiness. For example, a clinical<lb/> trial comparing 25 healthy individuals with 25 people<lb/> with seasonal AR found a significant increase in daytime<lb/> sleepiness reported by those with AR and these patients<lb/> also reported significant impairment to their quality<lb/> of life. The impact was related to the severity of the<lb/> disease <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>. Interestingly, data from SNAPSHOT shows<lb/> that most subjects experience low levels of daytime<lb/> sleepiness, despite over half describing their symptoms as<lb/> moderate/severe. However, this may be a consequence of<lb/> most subjects reporting symptom control.<lb/></p>

			<p>As with all studies, limitations do exist. These include<lb/> the fact the survey was telephone based, which could<lb/> introduce a sampling bias if certain groups do not have<lb/> access to a telephone, such as those in more remote, rural<lb/> areas. However, the SNAPSHOT program considered<lb/> both mobile and fixed landline telephone numbers to be<lb/> eligible, and the emergence of mobile telephones means<lb/> that most households in these countries have access<lb/> to a telephone. The survey was conducted by trained<lb/> lay interviewers; and the case definition is based on<lb/> perceived symptoms with no physician confirmation.<lb/> However, the clinical definition of AR is difficult to<lb/> implement in an epidemiological setting where large<lb/> populations are studied, since it is not possible to obtain<lb/> laboratory evidence of an immune response. As is the<lb/> case for all studies that require participants to recall<lb/> data, there is a risk of inaccuracy in the data collected. In<lb/> addition, as explained in detail earlier, the interpretation<lb/> of the first question of the SFAR in this region is likely<lb/> to have excluded a number of subjects with AR from the<lb/> program resulting in a potential underestimation of the<lb/> prevalence of AR in the countries studied. It is important<lb/> to collect data on symptoms of AR in such countries,<lb/> since awareness of AR as a disease is low in the region.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>This study provides an updated prevalence estimate for<lb/> AR and information on the disease burden within the<lb/> adult general population of five countries in the Middle<lb/> East region, using an identical methodology across all<lb/> countries studied. Although the observed prevalence<lb/> of AR in these Middle Eastern countries is lower<lb/> than that reported in western countries, its burden is<lb/> considerable. AR, and specifically uncontrolled and<lb/> severe disease results in a negative impact on quality<lb/> of life, quality of sleep and daily activities. The results<lb/> from this study can contribute to informed decision<lb/> making when setting priorities for public health policy<lb/> and strategy to manage AR in these countries.</p>
