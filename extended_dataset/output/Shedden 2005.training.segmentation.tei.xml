The predominant symptom of this <lb/>Abstract <lb/>condition is nasal congestion, which has a significant impact on quality of life and work productivity. This large <lb/>survey was conducted to determine the impact of nasal congestion on the above parameters in individuals with <lb/>allergic rhinitis, and treatment patterns for this symptom. <lb/>Methods: Participants were recruited voluntarily via telephone surveys and internet advertisements. Respon-<lb/>dents with nasal congestion as a symptom of their allergic rhinitis (or who were primary caregivers to a child <lb/>with nasal congestion associated with allergic rhinitis) were eligible for participation and completed a 52-ques-<lb/>tion internet survey. Data were normalized to the US adult population using a weighting algorithm. <lb/>Results: Of the 2355 individuals with allergic rhinitis screened for participation in the survey, 2002 (85%) had <lb/>nasal congestion. This was considered severe by 40% of respondents, compared with fewer than 30% who <lb/>considered any other individual allergy symptom to be severe. Nasal congestion was the symptom that most <lb/>adults and children wished to prevent, and it affected most respondents at work or school, had a notable <lb/>emotional impact, and interfered with their ability to perform daily activities. Only 13% of participants receiving <lb/>allergic rhinitis medication of any type, including over-the-counter medications, claimed to be very satisfied with <lb/>treatment, and only 20% adhered completely to prescribing instructions. Although intranasal corticosteroids are <lb/>recommended as first-line therapy for nasal congestion, only 30% of respondents with severe nasal congestion <lb/>received treatment with intranasal corticosteroids. <lb/>Conclusions: Nasal congestion affects most individuals with allergic rhinitis, and has a notable impact on <lb/>quality of life, emotional function, productivity, and the ability to perform daily activities. Patients need to be <lb/>better educated on the appropriate use of medications, particularly intranasal corticosteroids, to manage their <lb/>nasal congestion. <lb/></front>

Furthermore, given <lb/>that this was an internet survey, participation was restricted to <lb/>individuals with internet access. Whether this affects the general-<lb/>isability of the results is difficult to gauge, although it may be <lb/>hypothesized that those with access to the internet have a higher <lb/>socioeconomic status than those without, and therefore, better <lb/>healthcare access. This would suggest that, in fact, the actual <lb/>impact of nasal congestion may be greater in the general popula-<lb/>tion than indicated by this survey. In addition, allergic rhinitis was <lb/>self-reported in this survey, with no clinical or immunologic <lb/>confirmation of diagnosis required. Thus, some individuals com-<lb/>pleting the survey may have had a form of rhinitis that was not <lb/>mediated by an allergic response; however, this is unlikely to <lb/>affect the conclusions of the survey with respect to nasal conges-<lb/>tion being troublesome and inadequately treated. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>In summary, the findings of this large internet survey demon-<lb/>strate that nasal congestion affects most individuals with allergic <lb/>rhinitis and has a significant impact on quality of life, emotional <lb/>50 <lb/>40 <lb/>Respondents (%) <lb/>30 <lb/>20 <lb/>62 <lb/>47 <lb/>34 <lb/>33 <lb/>29 <lb/>22 <lb/>21 <lb/>20 <lb/>7 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>0 <lb/>6 0 <lb/>70 <lb/>Forgot to take it <lb/>Stopped experiencing <lb/>symptoms <lb/>Didn&apos;t feel it <lb/>was necessary <lb/>Didn&apos;t feel as much <lb/>medication was needed <lb/>Inconvenient to take <lb/>Just didn&apos;t feel like it <lb/>Wanted to <lb/>save money <lb/>Concern about <lb/>side effects <lb/>Fear of addiction <lb/>Other <lb/>Fig. 5.
