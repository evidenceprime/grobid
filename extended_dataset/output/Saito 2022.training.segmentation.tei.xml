We investigated <lb/>the changes in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of gastric mucosal <lb/>lesions after the publication of the supplement, examined the risk factors, and <lb/>developed a predictive model for post-ESD bleeding. <lb/>Methods: We included 2272 gastric ESD cases from our hospital between <lb/>May 2003 and June 2021 and classified them into two groups: 1789 cases <lb/>before and 483 after the publication of the supplementary guidelines. A pre-<lb/>dictive model for post-ESD bleeding was developed using the pre-publication <lb/>cohort data. <lb/>Results: The proportion of patients receiving warfarin decreased (5.0% vs. <lb/>1.4%) and those receiving direct oral anticoagulants increased (1.2% vs. <lb/>6.8%) after the publication of the supplementary guidelines. Post-ESD bleed-<lb/>ing occurred in 61 patients, but there was no significant difference in the <lb/>bleeding rate between the groups (50 [2.8%] vs. 11 [2.3%] patients, respec-<lb/>tively). Five risk factors (number of antithrombotic agents, dialysis, heparin <lb/>replacement, resection specimen size, and procedure time) were identified <lb/>for model development. The C-statistic for the model and post-publication <lb/>cohorts were 0.83 and 0.72, respectively. In the model, each risk factor for <lb/>postoperative bleeding was scored, and the risk was classified into three lev-<lb/>els according to the total score. Bleeding rates at low, intermediate, and high <lb/>risks were 1.6%, 10.3%, and 38.9%, respectively. <lb/>Conclusion: Despite changes in patient characteristics and clinical prac-<lb/>tice regarding ESD before and after the publication of the supplementary <lb/>guidelines, we could still develop a simple and useful predictive model. <lb/>K E Y W O R D S <lb/>anticoagulants, antithrombotic agents, bleeding, endoscopic submucosal dissection, risk factors <lb/></front>

			<body>anticoagulants (DOACs), aspirin, and P2Y12 receptor <lb/>antagonists. 9,10 In 2012, the Japan Gastroenterologi-<lb/>cal Endoscopy Society published the &quot;Guidelines for <lb/>gastroenterological endoscopy in patients undergoing <lb/>antithrombotic treatment.&quot; 11 In July 2017, it published <lb/>a supplement 12 specifying that DOACs should only be <lb/>discontinued briefly when performing endoscopic pro-<lb/>cedures with a high risk for bleeding. Due to calls to <lb/>verify the validity of these guidelines, we examined <lb/>changes in ESD for gastric tumors after the publication <lb/>of the supplement in a local community hospital.We also <lb/>examined the risk factors for post-ESD bleeding and <lb/>developed a predictive model. Although predictive mod-<lb/>els have been constructed in previous studies, these <lb/>may have been affected by external factors, such as <lb/>changes in the guidelines. Therefore, we aimed to con-<lb/>struct a predictive model and clarify the status of gastric <lb/>ESD at our local community hospital before and after the <lb/>publication of the supplementary guidelines to examine <lb/>the risk factors for bleeding after gastric ESD. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Study design <lb/>This was a retrospective study of gastric ESD cases <lb/>registered in our hospital database. The authors con-<lb/>ducted this study in accordance with the Declaration of <lb/>Helsinki and obtained approval from the hospital&apos;s eth-<lb/>ical review committee. Informed consent was obtained <lb/>from all patients and their families. <lb/>Description of setting <lb/>As a core hospital in our region, we targeted local res-<lb/>idents for ESD without distinction. Approximately 100-<lb/>150 gastric ESDs per year were performed by multiple <lb/>gastroenterologists; proficiency varied from trainees to <lb/>experts. Approximately 20 physicians were involved in <lb/>this study. <lb/>The patients were admitted to the hospital one day <lb/>prior to the procedure. ESD was performed using the <lb/>Olympus-Medical (Tokyo, Japan) Dual knife, Hook knife, <lb/>and IT knife, as per the surgeon&apos;s preference. Sodium <lb/>hyaluronate and saline solution were used for submu-<lb/>cosal injection, and VIO 300D (ERBE, Germany) was <lb/>used to generate high frequencies. Intraoperative anes-<lb/>thesia was administered with small doses of midazolam <lb/>or flunitrazepam as a sedative and pethidine hydrochlo-<lb/>ride as the analgesic. Hemostasis of the ulcer base after <lb/>ESD was achieved through cauterization using hemo-<lb/>static forceps or the clip method;polyglycolic acid sheets <lb/>were occasionally used to cover or close the ulcer base <lb/>when using the clip method. Patients were administered <lb/>20 mg omeprazole twice daily as they were fasting on <lb/>the day of treatment and the following day.Subsequently, <lb/>omeprazole was replaced with 30 mg oral lansoprazole, <lb/>20 mg esomeprazole, or 20 mg vonoprazan fumarate <lb/>before meals. Some surgeons performed second-look <lb/>endoscopy the day after treatment. Barring complica-<lb/>tions, most patients were discharged within 5-6 days <lb/>postoperatively. <lb/>Patient selection <lb/>We evaluated all cases of ESD performed at our <lb/>hospital between May 2003 and July 2021 that were <lb/>registered in the database. We followed up patients in <lb/>the usual outpatient setting for ≥1 year, barring spe-<lb/>cial circumstances. Patients with submucosal tumors, <lb/>hyperplastic polyps, non-carcinomas or non-adenomas, <lb/>or missing required data were excluded. <lb/>Cases were divided into two groups: those who under-<lb/>went ESD before and those who underwent ESD after <lb/>July 2017, the time of publication of the supplemen-<lb/>tal guidelines. If multiple lesions were resected en <lb/>bloc, they were considered a single case. Anticoagu-<lb/>lants were defined as warfarin and DOACs (dabigatran, <lb/>rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). <lb/>Study variables <lb/>The variables in this study included patient character-<lb/>istics (age and sex), medications at the time of ESD <lb/>(types of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and steroids), <lb/>comorbidities at the time of ESD (atrial fibrillation, <lb/>valvular disease, deep vein thrombosis, diabetes mel-<lb/>litus, hemodialysis, and liver cirrhosis), lesions (site, <lb/>resection specimen size, procedure time, macroscopic <lb/>type, ulcer, histology, and depth of invasion), and patient <lb/>outcomes (curability of ESD, intraoperative and post-<lb/>operative perforation, postoperative bleeding, death, <lb/>and thromboembolism associated with withdrawal of <lb/>anticoagulants). Antiplatelet agents included aspirin, <lb/>cilostazol, and P2Y12 receptor antagonists. Anticoagu-<lb/>lants and antiplatelet agents were collectively referred <lb/>to as antithrombotic agents. Withdrawal and resumption <lb/>of antithrombotic drugs were based on the guidelines <lb/>and decisions of the attending physicians. However, <lb/>a few patients discontinued the drugs independently <lb/>or extended the withdrawal period at the discretion <lb/>of their physicians. Post-ESD bleeding was defined <lb/>as hematemesis or hemoptysis and a decrease in <lb/>post-ESD peripheral blood hemoglobin level by at least <lb/>2.0 g/dl. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>R ver. 3.6.3 was used for statistical analysis (R Foun-<lb/>dation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

			<body>carcinoma may be due to improvements in endoscopic <lb/>performance and image quality. <lb/>Comparison with previous studies <lb/>Unlike previous reports, 10 the type of DOAC was not <lb/>an independent risk factor for post-ESD bleeding in this <lb/>study. We speculate that this was due to an insufficient <lb/>number of patients and fewer bleeding events (apixa-<lb/>ban, n = 2; rivaroxaban and edoxaban, n = 1 each). The <lb/>definition of bleeding in this study was based on previ-<lb/>ous reports, 14 and although slightly lower, the bleeding <lb/>rate in this study was similar to those in previous reports. <lb/>However, the resection specimen size was a significant <lb/>risk factor for post-ESD bleeding in this study, as in a <lb/>previous study. 15 One previous large study 13 that also <lb/>developed a predictive model for bleeding after ESD lim-<lb/>ited the cases to those with early gastric cancer, while <lb/>our study included those with early gastric cancer and <lb/>adenoma. Additionally, our study included cases treated <lb/>after the publication of the supplemental guidelines, <lb/>unlike previous studies. <lb/>Clinical implications <lb/>Two cases of thromboembolism associated with anti-<lb/>coagulant withdrawal were observed in this study and <lb/>involved warfarin replacement with heparin. The sup-<lb/>plemental guidelines recommend endoscopic treatment <lb/>with continuous warfarin therapy if the prothrombin time-<lb/>international normalized ratio is within the therapeutic <lb/>range or a temporary change to DOAC for non-valvular <lb/>atrial fibrillation. Both cases were noted before the <lb/>publication of the supplemental guidelines. Therefore, <lb/>the supplement recommending short-term withdrawal <lb/>or continuation of antithrombotic agents may prevent <lb/>thromboembolism without increasing the postoperative <lb/>bleeding rate. <lb/>Only five variables were incorporated into the predic-<lb/>tion model because of the number of events in the pre-<lb/>publication group. The following were significant: &quot;two <lb/>or more antithrombotic medications,&quot; &quot;heparin replace-<lb/>ment,&quot; &quot;hemodialysis,&quot; and &quot;specimen size ≥38 mm.&quot; <lb/>All variables are known or expected to contribute to <lb/>postoperative bleeding. &quot;Two or more antithrombotic <lb/>medications,&quot; &quot;heparin replacement,&quot; &quot;hemodialysis,&quot; and <lb/>&quot;large specimen size&quot; are reported risk factors for <lb/>postoperative bleeding. 9,10,15,16 Although there are no <lb/>reports of &quot;procedure time&quot; as a risk factor, we included <lb/>it because it is likely to be influenced by a combination <lb/>of the surgeon&apos;s skill, surgical difficulty, and frequency of <lb/>intraoperative bleeding and hemostasis. <lb/>Regarding the Kaplan-Meier curve, the high-risk <lb/>group was clearly more likely to bleed within 14 days <lb/>after the endoscopic procedure. Therefore, additional <lb/>endoscopic observation should be considered not only <lb/>immediately after but also during the 1-2 weeks after <lb/>the procedure. <lb/>Limitations and strengths <lb/>The reduction in the operative time before and after <lb/>the publication of the guidelines suggests that ESD <lb/>techniques may have improved over time, possibly intro-<lb/>ducing bias. Furthermore, this study was limited by <lb/>its single-center, retrospective nature. Compared with <lb/>previous multicenter studies 15 that developed predic-<lb/>tion models for post-ESD bleeding, fewer cases were <lb/>included in this study; therefore, only five variables were <lb/>included in the model. However, the performance of the <lb/>model was good, with an AUC of 0.83, better than that in <lb/>previous studies. Even after the publication of the sup-<lb/>plementary guidelines, the model&apos;s accuracy remained <lb/>good, with an AUC of 0.72. Generally, the accuracy of <lb/>risk models declines as the environment changes over <lb/>time. 17 The model in this study functioned effectively <lb/>even when the time axis was different and clinical prac-<lb/>tice was supposed to be different due to changes in the <lb/>guidelines, thus indicating its robustness. <lb/>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study <lb/>to compare the results of a predictive model for post-<lb/>ESD bleeding before and after the publication of these <lb/>supplementary guidelines. In other words, this study is <lb/>the first to show that a prediction model based on pre-<lb/>publication data can be applied to post-publication data <lb/>and that the AUC for post-publication data can be as <lb/>good as 0.72. Furthermore, this study suggests that the <lb/>BEST-J score of Hatta et al. 13 may also be applicable <lb/>to daily practice. We conduct our daily practice in accor-<lb/>dance with the supplemental guidelines and believe that <lb/>this is of sufficient clinical significance. On the other <lb/>hand, the predictive model in this study produced com-<lb/>parable results with fewer variables than the BEST-J <lb/>score. Although this is another strength of this study, it <lb/>is necessary to examine the generalizability and inter-<lb/>institutional differences using multicenter studies in the <lb/>future. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>There were changes in patient characteristics and clin-<lb/>ical practice regarding ESD after the publication of the <lb/>supplementary guidelines. Nevertheless, we developed <lb/>a predictive model for post-ESD bleeding that main-<lb/>tained accuracy over time. In the future, we would like <lb/>to introduce the developed model into clinical prac-<lb/>tice and conduct interventional studies, such as the <lb/>incorporation of prophylactic hemostasis in high-risk <lb/>patients and active endoscopic observation the day after <lb/>ESD. <lb/></body>
