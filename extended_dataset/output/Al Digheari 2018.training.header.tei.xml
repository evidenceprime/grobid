	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: The SNAPSHOT program provides current data on the allergic rhinitis burden in the adult general<lb/> population of five Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the<lb/> latter three grouped into a Gulf cluster).<lb/> Methods: A multi-country, cross-sectional, epidemiological program conducted by telephone in a random sample<lb/> of the adult general population; quotas were defined per country demographics. Subjects were screened for allergic<lb/> rhinitis using the Score For Allergic Rhinitis questionnaire. Current prevalence (last 12 months) was estimated. Disease<lb/> severity and control were assessed using the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma classification and Rhinitis<lb/> Control Assessment Test respectively. Quality of sleep, impact on daily activities and quality of life were measured<lb/> using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Sheehan Disability Scale and EuroQol Five-Dimension questionnaire respectively.<lb/> Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate risk factors and co-morbidities.<lb/> Results: 1808 of 33,486 subjects enrolled in the SNAPSHOT program fulfilled the case definition for allergic rhinitis.<lb/> Prevalence was 3.6% [95% CI 3.2-4.0%] in Egypt, 6.4% [95% CI 5.9-6.9%] in Turkey and 6.4% [95% CI 6.0-6.9%] in<lb/> the Gulf cluster. Risk factors identified were country, co-morbid asthma and income. Subjects with allergic rhinitis<lb/> reported a significantly lower quality of life compared to the general population (p &lt; 0.0001). Overall, 55% of allergic<lb/> rhinitis subjects were moderate/severe and 33% were uncontrolled. Both these groups reported impaired quality<lb/> of life and quality of sleep and increased impairment of daily activities compared to mild/well-controlled subjects<lb/> (p &lt; 0.0001).<lb/> Conclusions: Although the observed prevalence of allergic rhinitis in these Middle Eastern countries is low<lb/> compared to western countries, its burden is considerable. Allergic rhinitis in general, and specifically uncontrolled<lb/> and severe disease, results in a negative impact on quality of life, quality of sleep and daily activities.<lb/></div>
