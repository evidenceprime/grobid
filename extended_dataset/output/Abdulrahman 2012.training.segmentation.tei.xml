However, to date, there is a paucity of information related to physician-diagnosed AR in this region. The Allergies in Middle East <lb/>Survey was undertaken to help clarify and broaden the understanding of physician-diagnosed AR across Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United <lb/>Arab Emirates. The survey explores the frequency of physician-diagnosed AR, prevalence and types of associated symptoms, the impact on quality of life (QOL), <lb/>current treatment practices, and therapy expectations. <lb/>Methods: In total, 7411 households in five countries (Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates) were screened to identify <lb/>individuals that were Ն4 years old with a physician diagnosis of AR and either symptoms and/or treatment in the past 12 months. A total of 501 respondents <lb/>from the five countries completed the survey. Standardized questionnaires were used to make comparisons across the regions; however, the data collection <lb/>procedures were tailored for each country. The sample was probability based to ensure valid statistical inference to the population. <lb/>Results: Ten percent of the Middle East population surveyed had a physician diagnosis of AR, with 65% of respondents stating that their allergies were <lb/>intermittent in nature. An otolaryngologist or allergist diagnosed the majority of the individuals surveyed. Runny nose, nasal and throat itching, postnasal <lb/>drip, and nasal congestion or stuffed up nose were the most common and bothersome symptoms of AR. The majority of survey participants (58% of the overall <lb/>survey population) with AR reported that the condition had an impact on their daily private and professional life. Seventy-two percent of adults reported that <lb/>their AR symptoms limited their work/school activities and 35% reported that their AR interfered with and caused them to miss work or school within the <lb/>past 12 months. One factor, in addition to the outward AR symptoms, that could have contributed to these function impairments may have been sleep <lb/>disturbances. Although a secondary symptom to AR, sleep disturbances (difficulty getting to sleep, waking up during the night or lack of a good night&apos;s sleep) <lb/>were shown in this survey to be extremely troubling in ϳ15% of AR sufferers. In the past year Ͼ90% of patients reported taking a medication of any type <lb/>for their AR, with nearly a 4:1 ratio of patients taking a prescription medication versus an over-the-counter (OTC) medication in the past 4 weeks. Over 75% <lb/>of survey respondents reported taking an intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) in the last 4 weeks and the satisfaction rate of INCS medications was similar to that <lb/>reported for OTC medications. The most common reasons cited for dissatisfaction with INCS medications were inadequate effectiveness, bothersome side effects <lb/>(e.g., unpleasant taste and retrograde drainage into the pharynx), decreased effectiveness with chronic use, and failure to provide 24-hour relief. <lb/>Conclusion: These data show that AR is common in the Middle East region as elsewhere in the world. Many patients with AR in Middle East region suffer <lb/>from their symptoms (e.g., runny nose, nasal itching, nasal congestion, postnasal drip, and other symptoms) on all or most days during the times of the year <lb/>that their allergies are worst. These symptoms have been shown to reduce QOL and performance at work/school to a significant degree. Additionally, the survey <lb/>data underscore a considerable treatment gap with current therapies for AR and that many AR patients still have not found adequate effectiveness with <lb/>currently available medications. Thus, through identification of disease impact on the Middle East population and highlighting treatment gaps, clinicians in <lb/>the Middle East may better understand and treat AR, leading to improvements in overall patient satisfaction and QOL. <lb/>(Am J Rhinol Allergy 26, S3-S23, 2012; doi: 10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3836) <lb/></front>

			<body>T he prevalence of allergic diseases has been steadily increasing <lb/>worldwide to a point where the World Allergy Organization <lb/>estimates that 30-40% of the world population is now affected by one <lb/>or more allergic conditions. 1 In fact, respiratory symptoms including <lb/>acute infections and long-term conditions such as asthma, rhinitis, <lb/>and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are currently, worldwide, <lb/>the most common reason for patient presentation to a primary care <lb/>provider requiring intervention. 1,2 <lb/>Although the exact cause for the worldwide increase in allergic <lb/>disorders has not been elucidated, it is clear that allergies are becom-<lb/>ing more complex and sufferers frequently experience more than one <lb/>symptom. 3 Allergic rhinitis (AR), defined as an inflammatory condi-<lb/>tion of the nasal mucosa primarily mediated by an IgE-associated <lb/>response to ubiquitous indoor and/or outdoor environmental aller-<lb/>gens and characterized by nasal pruritus, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and <lb/>nasal congestion, in particular, is a very common chronic respiratory <lb/>disorder that affects between 10 and 30% (ϳ700 million people) of the <lb/>world population. 1 The prevalence of AR has also been increasing <lb/>and now has become the most common chronic medical condition <lb/>worldwide requiring active intervention. 2 What makes this statistic so <lb/>concerning is that AR is a known risk factor for asthma and has other <lb/>associated comorbidities that include sinusitis, nasal polyposis, con-<lb/>junctivitis, otitis media with effusion, upper respiratory infections, <lb/>and sleep disorders. 4,5 In addition to the associated comorbidities, AR <lb/>has been shown to have a direct and significant impact on an indi-<lb/>vidual&apos;s quality of life (QOL) and have significant direct and indirect <lb/>costs. 6 <lb/></body>

			<body>Poorly controlled AR can result in significant discomfort that can <lb/>impair productivity at work, performance in school, social interac-<lb/>tions, and sleep. 7-11 <lb/>Despite the epidemiological evidence showing a worldwide in-<lb/>crease in allergic disorders, a link to other comorbid conditions, and <lb/>significant impact on QOL, AR often goes undiagnosed or marginal-<lb/>ized as merely a nuisance by physicians and patients alike. In fact, <lb/>Valovirtra and colleagues reported more work productivity loss as-<lb/>sociated with AR than with several other chronic disorders including <lb/>depression, arthritis, migraines, and asthma. 12 This point is under-<lb/>scored by a recent survey in Spain. The results showed that one-third <lb/>of survey participants were not aware that they had AR. In addition, <lb/>a physician diagnosis of AR was not made in nearly one-half of the <lb/>AR sufferers who participated in the survey. The survey concluded <lb/>that the lack of effective communication between health care provid-<lb/>ers and patients led to poor treatment adherence and increased pa-<lb/>tient reliance on multiple agents as well as over-the-counter (OTC) <lb/>products. 13 <lb/>In adults, once AR has been correctly diagnosed, effective treatment <lb/>has been shown to improve QOL and even lower the risk of devel-<lb/>oping asthma. 14 However, to effectively manage AR and associated <lb/>QOL sequela, long-term use of medications that address the under-<lb/>lying inflammation will often be required. For this reason, current <lb/>international diagnostic and treatment guidelines recommend intra-<lb/>nasal corticosteroids (INCSs) as one of the most effective first-line, <lb/>long-term, treatment options for mild-to-moderate AR. 15-17 INCS <lb/>treatments have been shown to ameliorate all symptoms associated <lb/>with AR and are particularly effective in improving nasal congestion <lb/>in the chronic AR sufferer. 18,19 Second-line therapies may be recom-<lb/>mended in patients with moderate-to-severe disease and who are <lb/>either partially or unresponsive to INCS therapy. These include an-<lb/>tihistamines, decongestants, cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antago-<lb/>nists, immunotherapy, and nonpharmacologic therapies. 15 <lb/>Despite the numerous initiatives that are currently being under-<lb/>taken by various allergy organizations, a complete picture of the size <lb/>of the global allergy epidemic does not exist. Recently, several large-<lb/>scale surveys (e.g., Allergies in American Survey, Allergies in Latin <lb/>America, and Allergies in Asia Pacific) have attempted to further <lb/>clarify the prevalence of diagnosed AR, its impact on QOL, and <lb/>current treatment gaps in several regions of the world. 8,20-23 Unfortu-<lb/>nately, no such studies or surveys have addressed the true burden of <lb/>AR in the Middle East. Therefore, the Allergies in Middle East Survey <lb/>(AIMES) was undertaken in an attempt to further clarify the preva-<lb/>lence of AR, its impact on QOL, existing treatment paradigms and <lb/>treatment gaps associated with AR, and the medications currently <lb/>used to treat this disease. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Allergies in Middle East Survey <lb/>Included in this survey were adults, children, and adolescents Ն4 <lb/>years old residing in Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the <lb/>United Arab Emirates. Survey entry criteria included individuals <lb/>with a physician diagnosis of AR who were currently experiencing or <lb/>being treated for AR. Because AR may not have been a common term <lb/>understood or communicated to patients in the countries where the <lb/>interviews took place, other terms were also used in this survey to <lb/>describe AR. Therefore, a list of synonymous terms was provided to <lb/>screened individuals to ensure that the survey captured everyone <lb/>with the targeted condition. However, for the purposes of clarity, the <lb/>term AR will be used in this article to identify patients included in this <lb/>survey. A total of 5098 households from Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi <lb/>Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates were screened either by phone <lb/>or at in-person interviews, depending on the most appropriate mode <lb/>of screening and interviewing in a particular country. Individual <lb/>in-person screens were conducted with 2313 individuals in Iran in <lb/>place of the household screen used elsewhere. A total of 7411 screen-<lb/>ings were conducted that yielded 501 completed surveys across all <lb/>countries (Table 1). It is important to note that the population sur-<lb/>veyed and presented in this table were those individuals actually <lb/>diagnosed with AR by a physician. <lb/>Fieldwork was conducted between July and October of 2011. Tele-<lb/>phone and in-person interviewing were used. Most of the interviews <lb/>were conducted in urban areas because of the low telephone pene-<lb/>tration and lack of interviewing infrastructure in rural areas of the <lb/>Middle East. The average length of interviews was 36.2 minutes. <lb/>The survey was developed and conducted by Abt SRBI (New York, <lb/>NY), an international survey research organization. The survey spon-<lb/>sor was Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Osaka, Japan). <lb/>The maximum expected sampling error for a simple random sam-<lb/>ple of 501 cases (e.g., all respondents in the Middle East region) would <lb/>be Ϯ4.38 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. The maxi-<lb/>mum expected sampling error for a simple random sample of 409 <lb/>cases (e.g., the adult Middle East sample) would be Ϯ4.85 percentage <lb/>points at the 95% confidence level. The maximum expected sampling <lb/>error for a simple random sample for country-specific samples from <lb/>the Middle East survey would be Ϯ9.8 percentage points for sample <lb/>sizes of 100 at the 95% confidence level. It should be noted that <lb/>household sampling for in-person interviews was conducted with a <lb/>more complex design that used cluster sampling, so design effects <lb/>may increase actual sampling variance compared with simple ran-<lb/>dom sampling. <lb/>Development of Survey Questionnaires <lb/>Validated and standardized questionnaires specific to ascertaining <lb/>the prevalence, impact, and treatment gaps associated with AR, un-<lb/>fortunately, do not currently exist. Thus, through the use of survey <lb/>analysts from the research firm Abt SRBI, Inc., along with expert <lb/>physicians in the AR field from the Middle East, patient and health <lb/>care provider questionnaires were developed to accurately collect <lb/>relevant information on AR within the surveyed countries in the <lb/>Middle East. Questions included in this survey have been standard-<lb/>ized to survey questions previously used in previous surveys on <lb/>AR, 20,23-25 which include thousands of survey participants across <lb/>North America, South America, and Asia. A complete list of survey <lb/>questions can be found in Appendix A. <lb/>Table 1 Survey population and study sampling frame <lb/>Population <lb/>Individuals Ն4 yr old diagnosed with AR, symptomatic, or being <lb/>treated for allergic rhinitis in the past 12 mo <lb/>Sampling frame <lb/>Telephone and in-person screening of national or major city <lb/>sample <lb/>Interview length <lb/>Range, 20-75 min; mean, 36.2 min <lb/>Region <lb/>No. of Households <lb/>Screened <lb/>Completed <lb/>Sample <lb/>Egypt* <lb/>1274 <lb/>100 <lb/>Iran* § <lb/>2313 <lb/>100 <lb/>Lebanon* <lb/>790 <lb/>100 <lb/>Saudi Arabia# <lb/>1639 <lb/>100 <lb/>United Arab Emirates# <lb/>1395 <lb/>101 <lb/>Total <lb/>7411 <lb/>501 <lb/>*Participants screened via in-person interview. <lb/>#Participants screened via telephone. <lb/> §Iran is a nonprobability sample and interviews were not conducted in a <lb/>similar fashion to other countries. <lb/>AR ϭ allergic rhinitis. <lb/></body><header>S4 <lb/>November-December 2012, Vol. 26, No. 6</header> <lb/>D O <lb/>N O <lb/>T <lb/>C O <lb/>P Y <lb/><note place="footnote">Delivered by Ingenta to: UCL LIBRARY IP: 46.243.173.27 On: Mon, 20 Mar 2017 08:24:27 <lb/>Copyright (c) Oceanside Publications, Inc.

The developed questionnaires focused on general health; AR <lb/>triggers and symptoms; effects of AR on QOL including sleep, impact <lb/>on daily life, mood, absenteeism, and presenteeism. Perceived effec-<lb/>tiveness, expectations of treatment outcome and side effects of OTC <lb/>(all medications available without a prescription), and prescription <lb/>AR medications were also assessed. <lb/>Sample weights were developed to correct for sampling bias and <lb/>differences between eligible patients screened and eligible patients <lb/>actually interviewed. An age and gender correction ensured that the <lb/>interviewed population was similar to the screened population of <lb/>allergy sufferers. Cross-tabulation and frequency weighting was used <lb/>in all analyses to determine critical survey outcomes. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Demographics <lb/>A complete overview of survey participant demographics is <lb/>provided in Table 2. There were 409 adult participants (18-88 years <lb/>of age; mean, 35.0 Ϯ 11.6 years) and 92 children/adolescents (4-17 <lb/>years of age; mean, 10.7 Ϯ 4.0 years). Of the 501 total survey <lb/>participants, roughly, 55% were female subjects. The majority of <lb/>respondents reported having secondary education at a university. <lb/>Nearly 75% of survey respondents indicated that they had private, <lb/>public, or both forms of health insurance to cover medical care <lb/>costs. The average age at which a physician diagnosed AR was <lb/>20.5 Ϯ 12.3 years. <lb/>Forty percent of participants were smokers and 24% owned a pet, <lb/>both known risk factors for respiratory diseases such as asthma and <lb/>AR. Fourteen percent of survey participants reported having been <lb/>diagnosed with asthma/chest allergy in addition to AR. The country <lb/>with the lowest reported proportion of adults with asthma/chest <lb/>allergy and AR was Iran (3%) whereas Lebanon had the highest <lb/>proportion (41%). A complete Middle East and country-specific <lb/>breakdown of AR respondents with physician-diagnosed asthma is <lb/>shown in Fig. 1. In respondents reporting asthma, 68% reported having <lb/>asthma symptoms or an asthma exacerbation within the past year. <lb/>Prevalence and Patterns of Diagnosed AR in the <lb/>Middle East <lb/>The AIMES found that 10% of respondents had a physician diag-<lb/>nosis of AR or equivalent (Fig. 2). The prevalence of diagnosed AR <lb/>ranged from 8% in Lebanon to 11% in Egypt. Overall, 73% of survey <lb/>participants reported being diagnosed with AR (Table 3). <lb/>The majority (54%) of adult survey respondents reported being <lb/>diagnosed with AR by an otolaryngologist whereas primary care <lb/>providers (e.g., internal medicine and general practitioner/family <lb/>practice physicians) played a lesser role in the initial diagnosis of AR <lb/>(Table 3). After diagnosis, otolaryngologists were the most commonly <lb/>consulted health care provider for continued treatment of diagnosed <lb/>AR (Table 3). Overall, 46% of survey participants reported never <lb/>having had a diagnostic skin-prick test or blood test to confirm the <lb/>diagnosis of AR (Table 3). <lb/>Two-thirds (65%) of those surveyed indicated that they suffer in-<lb/>termittently from AR and approximately one-third (30%) reported <lb/>Figure 1.

Intermittent allergies were <lb/>most prevalent in Saudi Arabia (79%) and Egypt (68%). Persistent AR <lb/>was most common among respondents from Lebanon (44%), Iran <lb/>(43%) and the United Arab Emirates (42%; Fig. 3). <lb/>One noteworthy observation is that while nearly two-thirds <lb/>(65%) of respondents stated that their AR was intermittent in <lb/>nature, dust was the most commonly reported nonallergic trigger <lb/>for AR by 71% of respondents (Table 3). Other nonallergic triggers <lb/>commonly reported (Ͼ45% of respondents) were pollution, per-<lb/>fume, and tobacco smoke. When participants were asked during <lb/>what particular months of the year their AR was worst, spring and <lb/>fall months were commonly cited as being most troublesome (data <lb/>not shown). <lb/>Symptoms Associated with AR in Middle East <lb/>Patients <lb/>Individuals included in the AIMES were asked whether they still <lb/>suffer from AR or if their AR symptoms have diminished over time. The <lb/>overwhelming majority of respondents (98%) reported that they were <lb/>still troubled by their AR symptoms despite the fact that nearly all of <lb/>them (92%) reported taking a medication in the past 12 months to treat <lb/>their allergies (Table 4). When asked about the type of AR symptoms <lb/>most commonly experienced, respondents cited runny nose (57%), nasal <lb/>itching (56%), nasal congestion (55%), throat itching (52%), reduced <lb/>sense of smell (51%), and postnasal drip (50%).

Overall, 58% of respondents reported that <lb/>during the worst 1-month period of allergy symptoms, their daily life <lb/>was impacted at least moderately. This reported impact varied from <lb/>a high of 73% of respondents in Egypt to a low of 38% in Lebanon <lb/>(Table 5). <lb/>Figure 4.

There was <lb/>also variability among the countries surveyed with considerable dif-<lb/>ferences noted particularly for Iran and Lebanon compared with the <lb/>overall survey population (Table 5). <lb/>Activity limitations in daily life were reportedly affected signifi-<lb/>cantly by AR symptoms within the Middle East region. Collectively, <lb/>72% of respondents reported work/school performance was impaired <lb/>at least somewhat by their AR symptoms (Table 5). When specifically <lb/>asked how their AR symptoms affected their daily school/work <lb/>activities, over one-third (35%) reported that their AR interfered and <lb/>prevented them from performing their daily work/school activities <lb/>and caused them to miss work/school because of their disease (Table <lb/>5). As a corollary question, survey participants were asked to actually <lb/>rate their work/school productivity/output on a percentage basis in <lb/>the presence and absence of severe AR symptoms. These data showed <lb/>that there was an overall mean work productivity decrease of 27% <lb/>when their AR symptoms were most severe. Results were fairly <lb/>consistent across all individual countries (Table 5). <lb/>Roughly, 80% of the respondents reported that their sleep was <lb/>interfered with as a result of their AR symptoms. When the impact of <lb/>AR on these specific sleep indicators (getting to sleep, waking up <lb/>during night, and lack of a good night&apos;s sleep) was assessed, it was <lb/>surprisingly consistent across these three sleep measures for those <lb/>being quite a bit or extremely troubled (Table 5). <lb/>Current Status of AR Control and Treatment in the <lb/>Middle East <lb/>Eighty percent of the overall Middle East survey population re-<lb/>ported seeing a physician for their AR symptoms within the past year <lb/>with 55% of respondents reporting having seen a specialist at least <lb/>once (Table 6). On the average, there were five physician visits per <lb/>year as a result of AR symptoms. Additionally, 22% reportedly visited <lb/>a pharmacy at least two times for advice about their AR symptoms in <lb/>the past 12 months (Table 6). <lb/>When asked how well their AR symptoms have been controlled <lb/>over the previous 4 weeks, less than one-half (40%) of respondents <lb/>assessed their AR symptoms as completely or well controlled (Table <lb/>6). Furthermore, 15% of respondents assessed their AR symptoms as <lb/>poorly or completely uncontrolled (data not shown). <lb/>The vast majority of these individuals (86%) took some kind of <lb/>prescription medication to treat their AR symptoms. The most com-<lb/>mon form of medication used by 76% to control AR symptoms was a <lb/>prescription nasal corticosteroid spray. Use of nasal corticosteroid <lb/>sprays ranged from a high of 95% in Iran to a low of 30% in Saudi <lb/>Arabia. <lb/>When the use of desensitization methods (e.g., sublingual or sub-<lb/>cutaneous immunotherapy) was assessed, 42% of respondents said <lb/>Figure 5.

Although this <lb/>incidence may seem high, it is likely a function of survey participants <lb/>having to have had a physician diagnosis of AR to be included in the <lb/>survey. Use of this type of therapy ranged from a high of 57% in <lb/>Lebanon to a low of 19% in Saudi Arabia. A complete list of classes of <lb/>medications used to treat AR by Middle East survey respondents are <lb/>displayed in Table 6. <lb/>AR Treatment Expectations <lb/>When survey participants were asked whether there were truly <lb/>effective treatments currently available to control their disease, only <lb/>44% of respondents with AR agreed with this statement (Table 7). <lb/>Fifty-five percent agreed that the frequency of AR symptoms could be <lb/>prevented in most cases (Table 7). <lb/>When asked to specifically define what they would perceive as a <lb/>successful outcome after treatment with an INCS, an overwhelm-<lb/>ing 91% thought that an INCS should provide relief of AR symp-<lb/>toms within 3 hours after administration (Table 7). Surprisingly, <lb/>86% thought that INCS products were supposed to provide relief <lb/>for Յ11 hours whereas only 3% of respondents thought that nasal <lb/>steroid sprays should last Ն18 hours (Table 7). Respondents de-<lb/>fined a successful treatment outcome with an INCS product that <lb/>provides at least 82% symptom relief, has an onset of action of 2 <lb/>hours, and provides symptom relief for up to 4 hours. When partici-<lb/>pants were asked about safety, 60% thought that INCS products are safe <lb/>(Table 7). <lb/>Prescription Nasal Steroid Spray Use and Treatment <lb/>Satisfaction in the Middle East <lb/>The majority (83%) of survey participants cited using an INCS <lb/>product at some point over the past year to control their AR symp-<lb/>toms (Table 8). The major reasons cited for lack of use were related to <lb/>lack of severe symptoms, dislike of nasal sprays, and concern over <lb/>dependence. Side effects were provided as a reason by 7% of this <lb/>group (Fig. 6). <lb/>When respondents reporting that they had used an INCS product <lb/>within the past year were asked for the most important reason for <lb/>choosing an INCS, 40% responded that they were looking for fast <lb/>symptom relief and 21% were looking for long-lasting or complete <lb/>symptom relief (Table 7). When actual efficacy was assessed, 80% of <lb/>respondents stated INCS products gave them relief from most or all <lb/>AR symptoms (Table 8). When these same individuals were asked <lb/>about INCS efficacy over time, a significant portion (41%) stated that <lb/>their INCS lost effectiveness over the course of the day or night (data <lb/>not shown). In fact, most (49%) felt that the duration of effectiveness <lb/>was Ͻ4 hours. Moreover, 41% of respondents who had taken nasal <lb/>steroid sprays reported that the effectiveness tended to wear off after <lb/>initiating therapy (Table 8). <lb/>Nearly two-thirds (64%) rarely, if ever, changed their nasal <lb/>steroid spray once they started taking the medication; however, the <lb/>range across the individual countries was quite large. For example, <lb/>88% of respondents from Iran reported that they rarely, if ever, <lb/>changed their INCS product, whereas only 37% of respondents <lb/>from Egypt cited that they rarely, if ever, changed their ICS prod-<lb/>uct. A nearly equal number of respondents (38%) from Egypt also <lb/>said they change their nasal steroid spray several times a year, <lb/>which is much higher than respondents reported from other coun-<lb/>tries (Table 8). <lb/>When individuals who reported changing their INCS within the <lb/>last year were asked to provide a reason for changing, the majority <lb/>(47%) stated that the doctor changed their therapy. This was espe-<lb/>cially prevalent in Egypt where 69% of those respondents who <lb/>changed their INCS did so at the suggestion of the physician. <lb/>Smaller percentages of respondents reported their INCS change <lb/>being driven by lack of efficacy (27%) or waning of efficacy over <lb/>time (24%). Nearly one in three respondents (29%) stated that their <lb/>reason for switching INCS was because they wanted to try some-<lb/>thing else with the most common reason related to lack of effec-<lb/>tiveness.

Although other pub-<lb/>lications have higher estimated incidences, 3 it is important to keep in <lb/>mind that this study was not a true prevalence study, but rather <lb/>assessed the proportion of the population who were diagnosed with <lb/>AR. Reassuringly, the data presented here are consistent with previ-<lb/>ously published estimates of diagnosed AR in the United States, <lb/>Canada, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific regions when a physician <lb/>diagnosis of AR and active symptoms or treatment for AR in the past <lb/>year were used as a clinical validation of the self-reported health <lb/>condition. 20,23,25,26 <lb/>In addition to obtaining an understanding of incidence of AR <lb/>diagnosis, the data presented here also assessed the type, frequency, <lb/>and impact of the symptoms on patients. These data showed that the <lb/>vast majority of respondents reported that their allergies and associ-<lb/>ated symptoms were intermittent in nature and that otolaryngologists <lb/>or allergists were instrumental in the diagnosis of AR. Moreover, the <lb/>type of symptoms experienced by AR suffers as well as the impact on <lb/>their daily lives was highly concordant with other studies. 8,10,25-27 <lb/>It is well established that AR has a profound and far-reaching impact <lb/>on the sufferer&apos;s QOL, resulting in significant limitations in daily activ-<lb/>ities, social functioning, and work performance. 20,28-33 The data pre-<lb/>sented provide additional support to this concept in that almost all <lb/>patients with diagnosed AR reported that their condition had some <lb/>impact on their daily private and professional lives. These data support <lb/>findings from Valovirtra and colleagues who reported greater work <lb/>productivity loss associated with AR than with many other chronic <lb/>disorders including depression, arthritis, migraine, and asthma. 34 <lb/>Sleep impairment is another significant problem for patients with <lb/>inflammatory disorders of the upper respiratory tract such as AR. 28 <lb/>However, the impact of AR on sleep quality remains an underrecog-<lb/>nized component of AR morbidity. 35-40 Nasal congestion, the most <lb/>bothersome AR symptom identified in this survey, has been associ-<lb/>ated with sleep-disordered breathing and sleep impairment. 9,27 This is <lb/>highly concordant across all countries surveyed giving the authors <lb/>confidence that these overall findings were not spurious but repre-<lb/>sentative of a concomitant condition associated with AR. Moreover, <lb/>these data are in line with other published articles pertaining to the <lb/>relationship between impaired sleep quality and uncontrolled <lb/>AR 10,29,41,42 and will add to the growing data set of literature regard-<lb/>ing the profound impact that AR has on sleep. <lb/>The frequent and often times burdensome symptoms of AR along <lb/>with impaired sleep can also have a significant effect on allergy <lb/>sufferers&apos; lives and work productivity evident in the form of absen-<lb/>teeism and presenteeism. 33,43-45 According to the data presented here, <lb/>when AR symptoms are most severe, there is an appreciable decrease <lb/>in productivity. These presenteeism data were highly concordant <lb/>with data from the Allergies in America Survey as well as recently <lb/>published data from Latin America. 20,24,25 As with the sleep data <lb/>presented here, data on work productivity in the Middle East signif-<lb/>icantly contributes to the body of evidence showing the far-reaching <lb/>consequences of AR. <lb/>Another important aspect of AIMES was the data obtained related <lb/>to treatment patterns and the role of AR medications in treatment of <lb/>AR. Surprisingly, these data showed that the majority of participants <lb/>had seen a physician, in most instances a specialist, within the past <lb/>year for their AR, suggesting that AR sufferers will actively seek <lb/>therapeutic solutions to their symptoms, especially when access is not <lb/>limited by out-of-pocket payment. Not surprisingly, given the <lb/>amount of physician intervention, nearly all individuals in the survey <lb/>reported having taken some type of prescription medication to treat <lb/>their disease with the majority taking an INCS product. This makes <lb/>sense considering that the majority of respondent&apos;s AR was being <lb/>managed by specialists including otolaryngologists and allergists <lb/>who are likely to follow published AR guidelines recommending <lb/>INCS products as first-line therapy. <lb/>The data have shown that over 75% of survey respondents reported <lb/>taking an INCS within the last 4 weeks before the survey. Although <lb/>this incidence of use may seem high, it is important to recognize that <lb/>this survey population were those that had a physician diagnosis of <lb/>AR and, by extension, were likely to be treated for their disease. <lb/>Responses from survey participants confirm expectations that INCS <lb/>products will provide a high level of amelioration of their nasal <lb/>symptoms. Overall, when asked the expected overall percentage <lb/>symptom relief after taking an INCS product, respondents expected <lb/>this medication to alleviate the vast majority of their AR symptoms in <lb/>order for them to consider a treatment to be successful. Considering <lb/>the efficacy of INCS products, nearly all individuals who had taken <lb/>an INCS product in the past reported being somewhat to completely <lb/>satisfied with their INCS treatment. Because INCS products are con-<lb/>sidered the gold standard for AR treatment, it is critical to maximize <lb/>compliance and persistence to maximize the chance of treatment <lb/>success. In this regard, the current study identified specific reasons <lb/>why participants discontinued their INCS product. Major reasons <lb/>cited included lack of 24-hour symptom control, diminution of effect <lb/>with chronic use, and side effects related to unpleasant sensory attri-<lb/>butes associated with some INCS products (e.g., unpleasant smell, <lb/>large volume of spray, and throat run down). <lb/>Figure 8.

Additionally, the <lb/>majority of participants were college educated and lived in urban <lb/>areas, which bias the survey results and therefore results can not be <lb/>generalized to the entire Middle East region. Furthermore, symptoms <lb/>reported by participants may easily be seen in individuals with <lb/>chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent rhinosinusitis or upper respiratory <lb/>tract infections. This could potentially lead to misdiagnosis of AR <lb/>when, in fact, the individual has rhinosinusitis. This is especially <lb/>likely because the majority of patients were evaluated by an ear, nose, <lb/>and throat specialist and not an allergist (Table 3). <lb/>In conclusion, data from the AIMES have identified the impact of AR <lb/>on individuals with this chronic disease and has identified a number of <lb/>treatment paradigms and treatment gaps that currently exist in the <lb/>Middle East. It is the authors&apos; belief that these data will contribute to a <lb/>better understanding of the true burden of AR and, in turn, provide the <lb/>basis for physicians to provide better education to patients about their <lb/>condition and treatment options, which could, in turn, ultimately lead to <lb/>better treatment outcomes for patients with AR. <lb/></body><div type="annex">APPENDIX A <lb/>Household Screen for Persons with Allergic Rhinitis <lb/>Hello, I&apos;m ______ from (Name of Survey Organization), a national <lb/>research organization.
