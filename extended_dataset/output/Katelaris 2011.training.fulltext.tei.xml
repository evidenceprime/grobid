			<p>A llergic rhinitis (AR) is a highly prevalent chronic respiratory <lb/>illness that has been linked to multiple comorbid conditions, <lb/>including asthma. <ref type="biblio">1,2</ref> Poorly controlled AR has been shown to cause <lb/>significant patient discomfort and impairments in work productivity, <lb/>school performance, social interactions, and sleep similar to other <lb/>chronic conditions. <ref type="biblio">3-9</ref> <lb/></p>
			
			<p>Allergic disorders are estimated to affect some 1.4 billion people <lb/>globally and the prevalence continues to increase and now has be-<lb/>come the most common chronic medical condition worldwide requir-<lb/>ing active intervention. <ref type="biblio">10,11</ref> Recent data from Asia-Pacific suggests <lb/>that there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of AR within <lb/>this region within the past 10 years that exerts a significant economic <lb/>burden. <ref type="biblio">12-17</ref> Although it is unknown why the prevalence of AR is <lb/>increasing, experts have suggested that it is likely a consequence of <lb/>the changing environment, better hygiene and decreased infections, <lb/>and genetic susceptibilities. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> <lb/></p>
			
			<p>Consistent with treatment guidelines, treatment is usually based on <lb/>patient&apos;s age and severity of symptoms. <ref type="biblio">19</ref> Intranasal corticosteroids <lb/>(INCSs) are well regarded as the most effective treatment options for <lb/>AR and should be first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate disease. <ref type="biblio">19,20</ref> <lb/>Immunotherapy is another option as a disease modifying therapy for <lb/>AR. Moderate-to-severe disease not responsive to INCSs should be <lb/>treated with the addition of second-line therapies, including antihis-<lb/>tamines, decongestants, cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antagonists, <lb/>and nonpharmacologic therapies. <ref type="biblio">19</ref> <lb/></p>
			
			<p>Effective AR treatment has been shown to improve quality of life <lb/>(QOL) and may even lower the risk of new asthma cases developing <lb/>in adults. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> Despite these therapeutic benefits, AR often goes unrec-<lb/>ognized by physicians, resulting in inadequate control of symptoms. <lb/>This fact is underscored by a recent survey of Spanish individuals <lb/>with clinically confirmed symptoms of AR that showed that one-third <lb/>of survey participants were not aware that they had the condition, <lb/>and almost one-half had not been diagnosed by their physician. <ref type="biblio">22</ref> <lb/></p>
			
			<p>Several large-scale studies and surveys (e.g., Allergies in America, <lb/>Allergies in Latin America, and International Study of Asthma and <lb/>Allergy in Childhood [ISAAC]), have attempted to ascertain the true <lb/>prevalence of diagnosed AR, impact on QOL, and current treatment<lb/> gaps within the United States, Latin America, and the European<lb/> Union. <ref type="biblio">23-26</ref> However, the authors are unaware of any studies that<lb/> have attempted to ascertain, in the same study population, an assess-<lb/>ment of the prevalence of diagnosed AR, its patient-perceived impact<lb/> on QOL, current prescribing patterns, and treatment gaps within<lb/> Asia-Pacific. Given this dearth of data, the Allergies in Asia-Pacific<lb/> Survey was undertaken in an attempt to assess the prevalence of<lb/> physician-diagnosed AR and its impact on QOL, as well as existing<lb/> treatment paradigms and patterns and gaps associated with AR in an<lb/> effort to aid clinicians in optimally treating this highly prevalent<lb/> disease.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS</head><lb/> 
			
			<head>Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey<lb/></head>

			<p>Persons appropriate for inclusion in this survey were individuals<lb/> Ն4 years old, residing in Australia, China, Hong Kong, South Korea,<lb/> Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. These<lb/> individuals must have reported currently experiencing or being<lb/> treated for AR and having been diagnosed by a physician as having<lb/> AR, nasal allergies (NAs), hay fever, or sinus disease within the past<lb/> 1 year. It is important to note that individuals included in the study<lb/> were not required to have a skin-prick test to confirm the diagnosis of<lb/> AR although individuals were asked whether or not they had a<lb/> skin-prick test performed to confirm the diagnosis. Terms other than<lb/> AR were included because AR may not have been the common term<lb/> understood or communicated to patients in the regions where the<lb/> interview took place. Thus, a range of more or less synonymous terms<lb/> was provided to ensure that the survey captured everyone with the<lb/> target condition. However, for the purposes of clarity, the term AR<lb/> will be used in this article to identify patients included in this survey.<lb/></p>

			<p>Fieldwork was conducted between December 2009 and January<lb/> 2010. Telephone and in-person interviewing were used depending on<lb/> the most appropriate mode of screening and interviewing in a par-<lb/>ticular region. Translations of the questionnaire were performed in<lb/> each country where English was not the dominant language. In some<lb/> countries the questionnaire was translated into multiple languages.<lb/> Back translation was not performed; however, the advisors in each<lb/> country reviewed and validated the translation against the English<lb/> version of the questionnaire. Most of the interviews were conducted<lb/> in urban areas because of the low telephone penetration and lack of<lb/> interviewing infrastructure in rural areas of most of the Asian-Pacific<lb/> regions. It is important to note that in South Korea, traditional tele-<lb/>phone survey methods were not possible because of cultural sensi-<lb/>tivities in this region and individuals were included in the survey<lb/> only through physician referral, a methodology used previously in<lb/> other surveys assessing chronic conditions in South Korea. Given the<lb/> fact that a different methodological approach was used for South<lb/> Korea compared with the other eight countries, the South Korean data<lb/> were excluded from this analysis. This was done to reduce the pos-<lb/>sibility of imparting bias into the overall results because patients with<lb/> AR referred to an allergist or otolaryngologist may have had more<lb/> severe symptoms and hence have been a more severe population<lb/> compared with the population from the other countries that did not<lb/> require physician referral as a criterion for inclusion into the survey.<lb/> The findings from South Korea are intended to be published in a<lb/> separate article.<lb/></p>

			<p>Sample weights were developed to correct for sampling bias and<lb/> differences between eligible patients screened and eligible patients<lb/> actually interviewed. An age and gender correction ensured that the<lb/> interviewed population was similar to the screened population of<lb/> allergy sufferers. Cross-tabulation and frequency weighting were<lb/> used in all analyses to determine critical survey outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The maximum expected sampling error for a simple random sam-<lb/>ple of 1043 cases (e.g., the adult Asia-Pacific sample without South<lb/> Korea) was Ϯ2.7 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. The<lb/> maximum expected sampling error for a simple random sample of<lb/> 192 pediatric cases was Ϯ6.3 percentage points at the 95% confidence<lb/> level. The maximum expected sampling error for a simple random<lb/> sample for region-specific samples from Asia-Pacific was Ϯ5.7 per-<lb/>centage points for sample sizes of 300, and Ϯ9.8 percentage points for<lb/> sample sizes of 100 at the 95% confidence level. It should be noted that<lb/> household sampling for face-to-face interviews was conducted with a<lb/> more complex design using cluster sampling so design effects may<lb/> increase actual sampling variance compared with simple random<lb/> sampling.<lb/></p>

			<head>Development of Survey Questionnaires<lb/></head>

			<p>Validated and standardized questionnaires specific to ascertaining<lb/> the prevalence, impact, and treatment gaps associated with AR, un-<lb/>fortunately, do not currently exist. Thus, through the use of survey<lb/> analysts from the research firm Abt SRBI, Inc., along with expert<lb/> physicians in the AR field from Asia-Pacific, patient and health care<lb/> professional questionnaires were developed that accurately collected<lb/> relevant information on AR within the Asian-Pacific regions sur-<lb/>veyed. Because formally validated questionnaires do not currently<lb/> exist to obtain such data, the questions included in this survey have<lb/> been standardized to survey questions previously used in previous<lb/> surveys on AR, which include several thousand survey participants<lb/> across North and South America. <ref type="biblio">24-26</ref><lb/></p> 
			
			<p>The developed questionnaires focused on general health; AR trig-<lb/>gers and symptoms; and effects of AR on QOL including sleep,<lb/> impact on daily life, mood, absenteeism, and presenteeism. Perceived<lb/> effectiveness, expectations of treatment outcome, and side effects of<lb/> over-the-counter (OTC; all medications available without a prescrip-<lb/>tion) and prescription AR medications were also assessed.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS</head><lb/> 
			
			<head>Study Participation and Demographics<lb/></head>

			<p>A total of 33,378 households were screened to obtain 1235 com-<lb/>pleted interviews across the eight regions. There were 1043 adults and<lb/> 192 caregivers, with pediatric patients who had AR, who completed<lb/> the survey. An overview of the study design and number of house-<lb/>holds screened and surveyed, by region, can be found in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. It is<lb/> important to note that the population surveyed and presented in this<lb/> table were those individuals actually diagnosed with AR (NA, hay<lb/> fever, or sinus disease) by a physician.<lb/></p>

			<p>As can be seen in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, there were more female subjects included<lb/> in the survey compared with men. The mean age of children included<lb/> in the survey was 12.3 Ϯ 2.77 years and the mean age for adults<lb/> included in this survey was 36.9 Ϯ 13.3 years. The majority of respon-<lb/>dents reported that they were educated to a secondary or university<lb/> level. Most survey participants had either private or public insurance.<lb/> Less than 20% of respondents reported that they were not insured.<lb/> This demographic pattern was generally representative of the overall<lb/> population in Asia-Pacific.<lb/></p>

			<head>Prevalence and Patterns of Diagnosed AR in<lb/> Asia-Pacific<lb/></head>

			<p>The Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey found that 8.7% of respon-<lb/>dents across eight Asia-Pacific regions surveyed had a physician<lb/> diagnosis of AR, NA, sinus disease, or hay fever (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The preva-<lb/>lence of diagnosed AR ranged from 2.5% in the Philippines to 13.2%<lb/> in Australia. The vast majority of participants reported being diag-<lb/>nosed with either NA or AR (84% of adults and 87% of children). The<lb/> average age of doctor diagnosis of AR in adults was 26 years and 9<lb/> years for the children included in the survey.<lb/></p>

			<p>The majority of adult survey respondents reported having been<lb/> diagnosed with AR by an otolaryngologist (41%) or general practice<lb/></p>

			<p>physician (41%). Children were most commonly diagnosed with AR<lb/> by a general practitioner. Not surprisingly, in the majority of in-<lb/>stances, these were the same types of physicians that continued to<lb/> treat these individuals for their AR after initial diagnosis. The major-<lb/>ity of individuals who were surveyed reported never having a diag-<lb/>nostic test to confirm the presence of AR. Forty-one percent of adults<lb/> and 43% of children surveyed reported having had a diagnostic test<lb/> (either skin or blood test) performed to confirm the diagnosis AR. On<lb/> average, there was roughly an equal percentage of the survey popu-<lb/>lation that reported having had a skin-prick test (ϳ10%), blood test<lb/> (ϳ14%), or both (ϳ16%).<lb/></p>

			<p>Nearly two of three adults and over one-half of children with AR in<lb/> Asia-Pacific reported having seasonal allergies (Fig. <ref type="figure">2, A and B</ref>).<lb/> There was considerable variation among regions. Participants from<lb/> China reported having the highest incidence of seasonal allergies<lb/> whereas those from Singapore had the highest reported incidence of<lb/> perennial AR (Fig. <ref type="figure">2 A</ref>). It is worth mentioning that despite the<lb/> majority of survey participants citing that their AR was seasonal in<lb/> nature, the major allergy trigger reported by the entire survey pop-<lb/>ulation was dust, a typical perennial allergen (49% of adults and 56%<lb/> of caregivers of children with AR; data not shown) potentially indi-<lb/>cating that individuals are reporting a seasonal exacerbation second-<lb/>ary to a perennial allergy or nonspecific hyperresponsiveness.<lb/></p>

			<p>The other most commonly cited AR trigger was climate/humidity.<lb/> When participants were asked during what particular months of the<lb/> year is AR the worst, the results were concordant between adults and<lb/> children surveyed, with both groups having reported that October<lb/> through December were the months in which their AR was most<lb/> severe.<lb/></p>

			<p>When survey participants were asked to assess their general overall<lb/> health, over one-half of adults (56%) and nearly two of three caregiv-<lb/>ers of children (68%) rated general overall health as good to excellent.<lb/> Only 6% of adults and 4% of caregivers of children with AR rated<lb/> their health as poor or very poor (data not shown).<lb/></p>

			<p>When asked about concomitant medical conditions, one in five<lb/> adults and one in four children were reported having been diagnosed<lb/> with asthma in addition to AR (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The region with the lowest<lb/> proportion of adults with asthma and AR was Vietnam whereas<lb/> Taiwan and Hong Kong were the regions with the lowest reported<lb/> incidence of concomitant asthma in children. The region with the<lb/> highest proportion of adults with concomitant asthma was Aus-<lb/>tralia and the region with the highest reported incidence of con-<lb/>comitant asthma in children was the Philippines. It is worth men-<lb/>tioning that among those individuals who reported concomitant<lb/> asthma, nearly 50% of children and 60% of adults with asthma<lb/> reported having asthma symptoms or an asthma exacerbation<lb/> within the past year.<lb/></p>

			<head>Symptoms Associated with AR in Asian-Pacific<lb/> Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>Individuals included in the Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey<lb/> were asked whether they still suffer from AR or if their AR<lb/> symptoms have abated over time. The overwhelming majority of<lb/> adults (96%) and children (96%) reported that they are still trou-<lb/>bled by their AR. When asked about the frequency with which they<lb/> experienced specific symptoms, adults reported most commonly<lb/> experiencing nasal congestion (45%) and repeated sneezing (43%)<lb/> every day or most days when their AR was most severe (data not<lb/></p>

Caregivers of children with AR reported that their chil-<lb/>dren most commonly experienced runny nose (47%) and nasal<lb/> congestion (43%) most frequently during the days in which their<lb/> AR was the most severe (data not shown). The AR symptom<lb/> assessed as most bothersome was nasal congestion, followed<lb/> closely by repeated sneezing in the adult and pediatric survey<lb/> population.

			<p>Patients with AR reported a significant amount of discomfort dur-<lb/>ing NA attacks. Almost all AR sufferers (and caregivers of children<lb/> with AR) said that the discomfort during an allergy attack is not<lb/> something they can ignore. Close to one-half (46%) of adults and<lb/> slightly fewer caregivers of children with AR (39%) said that the<lb/> discomfort, secondary to AR, is something that they can not tolerate<lb/> without relief. The region where adults perceived the greatest dis-<lb/>comfort secondary to AR was China and the lowest was Singapore. A<lb/> similar finding was observed for children (data not shown).<lb/></p>

			<head>QOL Impact of AR in Asian-Pacific Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>The Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey also assessed the impact of NA<lb/> symptoms on QOL. Almost all adults and children with AR reported<lb/> that the condition had an impact on their daily life when symptoms<lb/> were at their worst (89% of adults and 82% of children; data not<lb/> shown). Over one-third of adult and caregivers with children re-<lb/>ported that AR affected their lives to at least a moderate degree when<lb/> symptoms were most severe (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The region where the impact of<lb/> AR was the greatest for adults and children was the Philippines.<lb/> Singapore and Malaysia reported the least daily impact of AR on<lb/> daily life in adults and Taiwan reported the least daily impact in<lb/> children (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>When adults and caregivers of children with AR were asked to<lb/> identify specifically how symptomatic AR impacted their daily activ-<lb/>ities, nearly one-half of the entire survey population reported that<lb/> their AR hindered them from performing well at work/school. Ad-<lb/>ditional limitations cited were the inability to have or play with pets,<lb/> limitations in participating in outdoor activities, and limitations in<lb/> participation in indoor activities. A complete by-region breakdown of<lb/> these data can be found in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nearly 50% of survey participants cited that their AR interfered at<lb/> some level with their work/school-related efforts with over one in<lb/> five survey participants having reported that their AR interfered with<lb/> their daily work/school activities and caused them to miss work/<lb/> school (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). When survey participants were asked to actually rate<lb/> their work/school productivity/output on a percentage basis in the<lb/> presence and absence of severe AR symptoms, these data showed<lb/> Ͼ20% reduction in work/school output/performance when AR<lb/> symptoms were most severe. Interestingly, the results were fairly<lb/> consistent across all individual regions for both adults and children.<lb/> A complete by-region breakdown of these data can be found in<lb/> Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey attempted to quantify the<lb/> impact of AR on sleep-related measures. Over 70% of the adult study<lb/> population reported being at least somewhat troubled by at least one<lb/> sleep indictor (e.g., falling asleep, awakening during the night, and<lb/> perception of lack of restful night sleep) secondary to their NA<lb/> symptoms whereas ϳ60% of caregivers of children with AR reported<lb/> being troubled by at least one sleep indicator (data not shown). When<lb/> the impact of AR on these specific sleep indicators was assessed,<lb/> the impact was surprisingly similar across these three sleep mea-<lb/>sures and between adults and children. A full overview of the<lb/> impact that AR had on sleep outcomes is presented overall and by<lb/> country in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Current Disease and Treatment Patterns: Perceptions<lb/> and Paradigms<lb/></head>

			<p>When NA sufferers were asked how well their AR symptoms have<lb/> been controlled over the past 4 weeks, nearly one-half, to slightly over<lb/> one-half, of adult respondents and caregivers of children with AR<lb/> assessed their symptoms of completely or well controlled. Moreover,<lb/> 13% of adults and 10% of caregivers of children with AR assessed<lb/> their NA symptoms as poorly or not controlled (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>With regard to physician visits for AR, nearly two-thirds of adults<lb/> and nearly three of four children reported seeing a physician for their<lb/> AR within the past with a smaller percentage reporting having seen<lb/> an AR specialist (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). Interestingly, only 58% of adults reported<lb/> they saw a physician for AR despite reporting that their AR was not<lb/> controlled at all (data not shown).<lb/></p>

			<p>When survey participants were asked whether there were truly<lb/> effective treatments currently available to control their disease, over<lb/> one-half of the survey population somewhat to strongly agreed with<lb/></p>

			<p>The current class of medications used to treat AR taken by survey<lb/> respondents are displayed in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. These data show that approx-<lb/>imately two-thirds of the overall survey population reported taking<lb/> some type of medication to treat their AR symptoms. The Philippines<lb/> had the highest proportion of people reporting taking some type of<lb/> prescription medication for their disease and Hong Kong had the<lb/> lowest proportion of patients taking some type of medication for their<lb/> AR. The reported use of prescription medication was approximately<lb/> one and one-half times greater than that of OTC use among those<lb/> adults and children surveyed (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). Slightly Ͼ10% of the overall<lb/> survey population reported taking some type of homeopathic remedy<lb/> (e.g., herbals) to treat their AR symptoms (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). Homeopathic<lb/> treatment usage was the highest in Taiwan and the lowest in Hong<lb/> Kong.<lb/></p>

			<p>When immunotherapy use was assessed, nearly one in four people<lb/> reported having used subcutaneous immunotherapy to treat their<lb/> disease. There was almost a two times greater reported sublingual<lb/> immunotherapy use in both adults and children compared with sub-<lb/>cutaneous immunotherapy use. The region that reported the highest<lb/> overall subcutaneous immunotherapy usage was Singapore and the<lb/> lowest was Hong Kong. By contrast, the region that reported the<lb/> overall highest use of sublingual immunotherapy was China and<lb/> the region with the lowest overall use incidence was Singapore.<lb/> Slightly Ͼ10% (11.6%) of individuals surveyed reported using both<lb/> sublingual and subcutaneous immunotherapy with Singapore having<lb/> the greatest overall concomitant use (13%) and Hong Kong having the<lb/> lowest reported concomitant use (0%).

			<p>Although corticosteroid nasal sprays are regarded as the gold<lb/> standard for treatment of moderate-to-severe AR, a surprising minor-<lb/>ity of individuals actually reported taking this class of medication.<lb/> When respondents were asked the reasons they did not use an INCS<lb/> product, the major reason identified was that they do not like nasal<lb/> sprays (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Other reasons included that their symptoms were not<lb/> serious enough to warrant use of an INCS product, lack of effective-<lb/>ness, and possible side effects/dependence (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Interestingly, cost<lb/> of INCS prescriptions was not cited as a major reason for not using an<lb/> INCS product.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the surprising underuse of INCS products in Asia-Pacific, an<lb/> assessment of possible reasons for this treatment pattern was made.<lb/> When a comparison was made between the proportions of patients<lb/> who reported being very satisfied with OTC medications compared<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Table 4 Current disease and treatment patterns: Perceptions and paradigms (percent of surveyed adults [children])<lb/> All<lb/> Regions<lb/> Australia<lb/> China<lb/> Hong Kong<lb/> Malaysia<lb/> Philippines<lb/> Singapore<lb/> Taiwan<lb/> Vietnam<lb/></figure>

			<p>with INCS medications, the results were similar between these two<lb/> classes of AR medications and similar between adults and caregivers<lb/> of children with AR (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). When survey respondents were asked<lb/> to assess the symptom relief experienced from an INCS product,<lb/> approximately two-thirds of adults and caregivers of children with<lb/> AR reported that their current INCS product relieves at least most of<lb/> their AR symptoms. As a corollary question, survey participants were<lb/> asked what defines a successful treatment outcome with INCS prod-<lb/>ucts. Adults and caregivers of children with AR reported they expect<lb/> Ͼ80% relief from their AR symptoms after taking an INCS (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).<lb/> When expectations of speed of symptom relief after INCS adminis-<lb/>tration, an overwhelming majority of respondents stated their expec-<lb/>tations were that an INCS product should provide AR symptom relief<lb/> within 3 hours after administration (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In follow-up questions related to efficacy of INCS products, survey<lb/> respondents were asked if they experienced their INCS medication<lb/> losing effectiveness over the 24-hour treatment interval as well as<lb/> losing effectiveness with chronic use. Surprisingly, approximately<lb/> one-half of the entire surveyed population indicated that their INCS<lb/> product loses, or has lost, effectiveness over 24 hours despite them<lb/> having a once-daily dosing indication (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). Additionally, more<lb/> than one in four survey respondents indicated that their INCS prod-<lb/></p>

			<p>uct loses effectiveness with chronic long-term use (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). It is worth<lb/> mentioning that Hong Kong had the fewest proportions of respon-<lb/>dents that perceived these efficacy shortcomings.<lb/> Discontinuation of INCS therapy overall, and by region, was also<lb/> assessed. These results show that nearly three of five adults and one<lb/> of two caregivers reported that an INCS product was discontinued<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, major reasons for respondents<lb/> reporting discontinuing their INCS product was caused by effective-<lb/>ness wearing off over time, lack of acceptable efficacy, and unpleasant<lb/> side effects. Interestingly, cost was only cited by a minority of adults<lb/> surveyed (2%) and was not listed by caregivers of children with AR<lb/> as a reason for discontinuing their INCS product.<lb/></p>

			<p>To further assess the perception of side effects, survey respondents<lb/> were asked whether side effects with INCS products are less bother-<lb/>some compared with other available AR medication. In response to<lb/> this question, only slightly over one-third of adults and one-quarter of<lb/> caregivers of children with AR reported that side effects with INCS<lb/> products are less bothersome than other medication used to treat AR<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). Moreover, one-quarter of adults and 28% of caregivers of<lb/> children with AR reported that they are unsure whether INCS prod-<lb/>ucts are safe for long-term use (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). When the specific types of<lb/> side effects experienced by users of INCS products were assessed, the<lb/> majority of survey participants reported that retrograde drainage into<lb/> the esophagus was the most frequently occurring side effect associ-<lb/>ated with their INCS medication. Other side effects reported by adults<lb/> and caregivers of children with AR included bad taste, drying feeling,<lb/> uncomfortable spray volume, and burning sensation. A full list of<lb/> commonly experienced side effects in allergies in Asia-Pacific popu-<lb/>lation can be found in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>AR is generally recognized as the most common chronic respiratory<lb/> disorder worldwide. <ref type="biblio">27</ref> The ISAAC survey, along with publications<lb/> from Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma, have recently re-<lb/>ported epidemiological and prevalence data for allergic respiratory<lb/> diseases in Asia-Pacific, South Korea, and Thailand. <ref type="biblio">12-14</ref> However,<lb/> prevalence estimates reported from ISAAC are limited to two age<lb/> cohorts (6-7 years and 13-14 years). Although these data provide<lb/> directional prevalence and incidence of data on the epidemiological<lb/> features of AR and asthma, they are limited because individuals were<lb/> only required to have symptomatology consistent with these diseases<lb/> and not confirmed by a physician. By contrast, the data from the<lb/> Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey were obtained from individuals who<lb/> actually had a physician diagnosis of AR. Moreover, this is the first<lb/> study, in which the authors are aware, that ascertained prevalence,<lb/> patient-assessed symptomatology, impact, and treatment paradigms<lb/> of AR among patients in Asia-Pacific within the same study.<lb/></p>

			<p>The data show that nearly 10% of the Asia-Pacific population<lb/> surveyed had diagnosed AR. Although this is lower than the pub-<lb/>lished estimates of AR for Asia-Pacific, which have been estimated to<lb/> be as high as 45%, it is important to keep in mind that in this survey<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 7. Reported side effects after intranasal corticosteroid use in (A)<lb/> Asian-Pacific adults and (B) Asian children and adolescents.<lb/> </figure>

			<p>patients actually needed to have been diagnosed with AR to be<lb/> eligible to participate in the survey. The author&apos;s recognize that is a<lb/> conservative approach and does not provide information of the true<lb/> prevalence of AR but rather only provides information on the prev-<lb/>alence of diagnosed AR. By contrast, other estimates only required a<lb/> survey participant to have symptoms consistent with the disease<lb/> within the past year. <ref type="biblio">28</ref> Because the survey was mostly performed in<lb/> urban areas, one could speculate that factors such as a hygienic<lb/> environment, higher diagnosis rate due to higher density of special-<lb/>ists, more pollution, etc. could potentially overestimate the prevalence<lb/> of AR-this, however, did not seem to be the case. In fact, the data<lb/> from the Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey are consistent with previ-<lb/>ously published estimates for AR in South Korea as well as Austra-<lb/>lia. <ref type="biblio">29,30</ref> Additionally, the data presented here are consistent and in the<lb/> range of the diagnosed AR population from the United States, Can-<lb/>ada, and Latin America when using the same criteria of a physician<lb/> diagnosis of AR as a clinical validation of the self-reported health<lb/> condition. <ref type="biblio">24,26,31</ref> Hence, it is important to recognize that the appar-<lb/>ently discordant prevalence estimates between this survey and<lb/> ISAAC do not necessarily mean that the survey data presented here<lb/> are flawed, but rather that the rates of physician diagnosis of AR are<lb/> likely low.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>These survey data showed that the worst months for AR exacerba-<lb/>tions were October through December. Although the authors do not<lb/> have a definitive reason as to why these months were perceived by<lb/> AR patients as ones in which their AR symptoms were most severe,<lb/> one explanation could be that these months immediately follow the<lb/> rainy season in most regions surveyed, which may contribute to an<lb/> increase in native flora resulting in higher pollen counts during the<lb/> October through December months. Another possible reason for this<lb/> finding may be related to the fact that changes in temperature and<lb/> humidity can act as triggers for the nonspecific hyperresponsiveness<lb/> or hyperreactivity and not because of AR itself.<lb/></p>

			<p>The types of symptoms experienced by NA suffers as well as the<lb/> impact on their daily lives were highly concordant with other studies<lb/> reporting the impact on QOL and treatment gaps that currently exist<lb/> in the treatment of AR. For example, the most bothersome symptoms<lb/> reported by this survey population included nasal congestion, sneez-<lb/>ing, runny nose, and headaches, which were consistent with those<lb/> reported in other studies. <ref type="biblio">4,6,26,31,32<lb/></ref></p> 
			
			<p>It is well established that AR has a profound impact on QOL. Not<lb/> only do people with AR complain of what some consider as &quot;nuisance<lb/> symptoms,&quot; they also have significant limitations in daily activities<lb/> and limitations in social functioning as well as impaired work per-<lb/>formance. <ref type="biblio">21,33-38</ref> The data presented here are concordant with other<lb/> published data from the region and also show that almost all patients<lb/> with diagnosed AR reported that their condition had some impact on<lb/> their daily lives. <ref type="biblio">39,40</ref> It is worth mentioning that Singapore survey<lb/> participants reported that AR symptoms had the least daily impact on<lb/> daily life. Although the authors have no definitive explanation for this<lb/> finding, one may speculate that given the fact that this is the richest<lb/> country of all surveyed that individuals homes and workplaces are<lb/> perhaps more allergen free and thus individuals are less likely to<lb/> come into contact with exacerbating allergens. Alternatively, this<lb/> region had the highest use of disease-modifying subcutaneous im-<lb/>munotherapy, likely ascribed to the healthiness of the country and, by<lb/> extension, access to comprehensive health care.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another finding was the fact that the region that reported the<lb/> highest subcutaneous immunotherapy usage was Singapore whereas<lb/> China reported the overall highest use of sublingual immunotherapy.<lb/> Although the author&apos;s do not have an exact reason for this finding,<lb/> one could speculate that Singapore has health care practices similar to<lb/> western medicine practices in the United States and United Kingdom<lb/> where subcutaneous immunotherapy is used quite frequently in se-<lb/>vere cases of AR. China, by contrast, uses more of the traditional<lb/> Chinese medicine approach to treating disease. As such, one could<lb/> speculate that the sublingual approach to immunotherapy treatment<lb/> in this region could be perceived as more akin to other traditional<lb/> Chinese medicine treatment modalities, thus providing a rationale for<lb/> this finding.<lb/></p>

			<p>Sleep impairment is another significant problem for patients with<lb/> AR, rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> Although chronic sleep<lb/> disturbance has been linked to more severe pathologies, the impact of<lb/> AR on sleep quality remains an underrecognized and undertreated<lb/> component of AR morbidity. <ref type="biblio">2,24,34,41-49</ref> Nasal congestion, one of the<lb/> common and most bothersome AR symptoms identified in this sur-<lb/>vey, has been associated with sleep-disordered breathing and is<lb/> thought to be a key cause of sleep impairment. <ref type="biblio">5,32</ref> The data presented<lb/> here show that nearly a significant number of adults and children<lb/> with AR reported either difficulty in falling asleep, awakening during<lb/> the night, or the lack of a restful night&apos;s sleep. These data were, for the<lb/> most part, highly concordant across all regions surveyed giving the<lb/> authors confidence that these overall findings were not spurious and<lb/> simply driven by an overestimated result in one or two regions within<lb/> Asia-Pacific. Moreover, these data are concordant with other data<lb/> published on the relationship between impaired sleep quality and<lb/> uncontrolled AR. <ref type="biblio">4,34,50,51<lb/></ref></p> 
			
			<p>The frequent and burdensome symptoms of AR as well as impaired<lb/> sleep can significantly affect allergy sufferers&apos; lives and work produc-<lb/>tivity in the form of absenteeism and presenteeism. <ref type="biblio">38,52-54</ref> The data<lb/> presented here show that individuals with AR had a Ͼ20% decrease<lb/> in productivity between days when they have no allergy symptoms<lb/> and days when their allergy symptoms are at their worst. Interest-<lb/>ingly, these data are consistent with the data from the Allergies in<lb/> America Survey as well as recently published data from Latin Amer-<lb/>ica. <ref type="biblio">24,26,34</ref> Like in the case of the sleep data presented here, these data<lb/> significantly contribute to the body of evidence showing the far-<lb/>reaching consequences of AR and for the first time provide and actual<lb/> quantitative impact of AR on work performance in the Asian-Pacific<lb/> population.<lb/></p>

			<p>The current study also investigated treatment patterns and the role<lb/> of NA medications in treatment of AR, including patient perspectives<lb/> on both effectiveness and bothersome side effects associated with<lb/> these medications. These data showed that nearly three of four survey<lb/> participants have seen a physician within the past year for their AR<lb/> with nearly 60% reporting seeing a specialist for their disease. This is<lb/> not completely surprising given the fact that almost all NA sufferers<lb/> said that discomfort during an allergy attack could not be ignored,<lb/> with nearly one-half of participants citing that that the discomfort is<lb/> something that they can not tolerate. These data were supported by<lb/> the fact that the majority of individuals in this survey took some type<lb/> of medication to treat their AR symptoms, with over one-half report-<lb/>ing having taken some type of prescription medication to treat their<lb/> disease.<lb/></p>

			<p>What was surprising, however, was that only a minority of indi-<lb/>viduals reported taking an INCS product. Although on initial review<lb/> of these data may seem surprising, this was similar to the INCS usage<lb/> observed in Latin America and only slightly less compared with the<lb/> United States and Canadian experience. <ref type="biblio">24,26,31,34</ref> Initially, we specu-<lb/>lated that that the likely reason for underuse of INCS products in this<lb/> region was related to cost, given the fact that in certain areas in the<lb/> Asia-Pacific, INCS prescriptions can be up to 20 times more expen-<lb/>sive than the first-and second-generation antihistamines. <ref type="biblio">12</ref> Surpris-<lb/>ingly, however, it appeared to be caused by dislike of nasal sprays<lb/> and side effects. The dislike for nasal spray products is not totally<lb/> surprising given the fact that there is a considerable amount of data<lb/> regarding patient preference with INCS products as well as intranasal<lb/> migraine therapies that have shown that patient preference attributes<lb/> are a key driver to patient acceptance and adherence. <ref type="biblio">55-58</ref> Moreover,<lb/> these data are concordant with other studies that looked at sensory<lb/> attributes that patients found unpleasant. <ref type="biblio">24,59-61</ref> For example, Ma-<lb/>hedevia and colleagues found that lack of aftertaste was the most<lb/> important attribute of an &quot;ideal INCS product,&quot; followed by no<lb/> aftertaste, throat rundown and nose run-out, and that all of these<lb/>attributes contributed to patient acceptance and, by extension, patient<lb/> adherence to INCS therapy, suggesting that patient preference may<lb/> be an important driver in increasing patient acceptance and adher-<lb/>ence to intranasal NA medications. <ref type="biblio">62,63<lb/></ref></p> 
			
			<p>In addition to assessing current treatment patterns for AR in Asia-<lb/>Pacific, treatment gaps with AR medications were also analyzed. The<lb/> majority of individuals who reported taking an INCS product re-<lb/>ported that their INCS product relieved most of their AR symptoms,<lb/> with less than one-third of participants reporting that that they were<lb/> very satisfied with their INCS treatment. One reason for this low<lb/> satisfaction rate for INCS therapy could be the fact that patients with<lb/> AR expect a high amelioration of their nasal symptoms. When asked<lb/> the expected overall percentage symptom relief after taking an INCS<lb/> product, respondents stated that they expected upward of an 85%<lb/> reduction in AR symptoms in order for them to consider that the<lb/> therapy was successful. When reasons for discontinuing an INCS<lb/> product was assessed, the major reasons cited were lack of perceived<lb/> effectiveness specifically related to lack of 24-hour control of symp-<lb/>toms as well as diminution of effect with chronic use and side effects.<lb/> Thus, an AR medication that is effective in reducing severity of all<lb/> nasal symptoms associated with AR (e.g., rhinorrhea, nasal conges-<lb/>tion, sneezing, and itching) may more adequately meet a patient&apos;s<lb/> perception of an effective product leading to increased persistence<lb/> and compliance.<lb/></p>

			<p>One additional benefit of the Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey data<lb/> set was that it enabled an assessment if intracountry differences.<lb/> Although most data across Asia-Pacific were similar in terms of QOL<lb/> impact of AR, the region that reported the highest and lowest impact<lb/> of AR on daily life was the Philippines and China, respectively. It is<lb/> not totally surprising that the Philippines reported both the highest<lb/> QOL impact of AR and the highest medication usage for their disease,<lb/> supporting that patients that have a disease with a considerable<lb/> impact on daily life are likely to seek out treatments to reduce the<lb/> burden of their disease.<lb/></p>

			<p>When individual region treatment patterns for INCS use were<lb/> assessed, individuals from the Philippines had one of the highest<lb/> expectations for relief of AR symptoms and had the highest overall<lb/> satisfaction rates with INCS products. Despite this high overall sat-<lb/>isfaction rate, this region also had the highest proportion of patients<lb/> that reported an INCS effectiveness decreased with chronic use. Ad-<lb/>ditionally, this was the region that reported that medications used to<lb/> treat AR (e.g., OTC and immunotherapy) actually had a better side<lb/> effect profile compared with other currently available INCS products.<lb/></p>

			<p>As a follow-up study, it may be worth assessing treatment gaps<lb/> associated with other classes of medications (e.g., antihistamines and<lb/> nasal decongestants) and if the specific types and brands of AR<lb/> medications currently approved in these particular regions drove the<lb/> differences in treatment expectations and treatment gaps with INCS<lb/> products. An additional area of study is why the overall survey<lb/> population had a relatively low reported usage of subcutaneous<lb/> immunotherapy, which was not appreciably different from the over-<lb/>all reported usage of INCS.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, data from the Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey have<lb/> identified the impact of AR on individuals with this chronic disease as<lb/> well as having identified a number of treatment paradigms and<lb/> treatment gaps that currently exist in Asia-Pacific. It is the authors&apos;<lb/> belief that these data will contribute to a better understanding of the<lb/> true burden of AR and provide a basis for physicians to provide better<lb/> education to patients about their condition and treatment options,<lb/> which may ultimately lead to better treatment outcomes for patients<lb/> with AR.<lb/></p>
