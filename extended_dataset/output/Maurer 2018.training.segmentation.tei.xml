The deposition occurs when wild-type or variant trans-<lb/>thyretin becomes unstable and misfolds. Tafamidis binds to transthyretin, preventing <lb/>tetramer dissociation and amyloidogenesis. <lb/></front>

			<body>METHODS <lb/>In a multicenter, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we <lb/>randomly assigned 441 patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in a 2:1:2 <lb/>ratio to receive 80 mg of tafamidis, 20 mg of tafamidis, or placebo for 30 months. <lb/>In the primary analysis, we hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, followed by <lb/>frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations according to the Finkelstein-<lb/>Schoenfeld method. Key secondary end points were the change from baseline to <lb/>month 30 for the 6-minute walk test and the score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy <lb/>Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS), in which higher scores indicate better <lb/>health status. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>In the primary analysis, all-cause mortality and rates of cardiovascular-related hos-<lb/>pitalizations were lower among the 264 patients who received tafamidis than among <lb/>the 177 patients who received placebo (P&lt;0.001). Tafamidis was associated with lower <lb/>all-cause mortality than placebo (78 of 264 [29.5%] vs. 76 of 177 [42.9%]; hazard ratio, <lb/>0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.96) and a lower rate of cardiovascular-<lb/>related hospitalizations, with a relative risk ratio of 0.68 (0.48 per year vs. 0.70 per year; <lb/>95% CI, 0.56 to 0.81). At month 30, tafamidis was also associated with a lower rate of <lb/>decline in distance for the 6-minute walk test (P&lt;0.001) and a lower rate of decline <lb/>in KCCQ-OS score (P&lt;0.001). The incidence and types of adverse events were similar <lb/>in the two groups. <lb/></body>

			<front>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>In patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, tafamidis was associated <lb/>with reductions in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations <lb/>and reduced the decline in functional capacity and quality of life as compared with <lb/>placebo.

Median survival in untreat-<lb/>ed patients is reported to be 2.5 years after diag-<lb/>nosis for ATTRm caused by the TTR Val122Ile <lb/>mutation and 3.6 years for ATTRwt. 9,10 Death in <lb/>most patients is from cardiac causes, including <lb/>sudden death and heart failure. 9 <lb/>Transthyretin is a 127-amino acid, 55-kD pro-<lb/>tein that is primarily synthesized in the liver and <lb/>transports thyroxine and retinol-binding protein-<lb/>retinol (vitamin A) complex. 11,12 Fibrillogenesis oc-<lb/>curs when the tetrameric structure of the trans-<lb/>thyretin protein dissociates into intermediates, <lb/>which misassemble into soluble oligomers, <lb/>protofilaments, and amyloid fibrils. 13 Kelly and <lb/>colleagues discovered that a polymorphism in <lb/>TTR that encodes the amino-acid substitution <lb/>Thr119Met stabilized the protein in the context <lb/>of a destabilizing pathogenic variant (Val30Met), <lb/>leading to the development of tafamidis, 14,15 a <lb/>benzoxazole derivative lacking nonsteroidal anti-<lb/>inflammatory drug activity that binds to the thy-<lb/>roxine-binding sites of transthyretin with high af-<lb/>finity and selectivity and inhibits the dissociation <lb/>of tetramers into monomers. Tafamidis has been <lb/>shown to slow the progression of peripheral neu-<lb/>rologic impairment in transthyretin amyloid poly-<lb/>neuropathy. 16 <lb/>With respect to transthyretin amyloid cardio-<lb/>myopathy, a phase 2, open-label trial involving <lb/>31 patients showed that tafamidis (20 mg daily) <lb/>stabilized transthyretin and had an acceptable <lb/>safety profile. 17 A single-center, nonrandomized <lb/>study showed an association between tafamidis <lb/>and improved survival. 18 The Transthyretin Amyloi-<lb/>dosis Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT) 19 <lb/>was designed to determine the efficacy and safety <lb/>of tafamidis in patients with hereditary and wild-<lb/>type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. <lb/>Me thods <lb/>Trial Oversight <lb/>ATTR-ACT was a phase 3, multicenter, interna-<lb/>tional, parallel-design, placebo-controlled, double-<lb/>blind, randomized trial. Details of the trial have <lb/>been described previously. 19 The trial was over-<lb/>seen by a steering committee that included inves-<lb/>tigators and the sponsor. ATTR-ACT was approved <lb/>by the independent review board or ethics com-<lb/>mittee at each participating site and was con-<lb/>ducted in accordance with the provisions of the <lb/>Declaration of Helsinki and the International <lb/>Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Prac-<lb/>tice guidelines. All patients provided written in-<lb/>formed consent. The trial was designed by the <lb/>sponsor in collaboration with clinicians with expe-<lb/>rience in the treatment of transthyretin amyloid <lb/>cardiomyopathy. Investigators collected and held <lb/>the data in a blinded fashion until the data were <lb/>analyzed centrally by the sponsor. An external <lb/>data and safety monitoring board was responsi-<lb/>ble for monitoring patient safety and conducted <lb/>unblinded reviews of cumulative trial data. An <lb/>independent, end-point adjudication committee, <lb/>whose members were also unaware of the trial-<lb/>group assignments, determined whether investi-<lb/>gator-reported events met the definition of dis-<lb/>ease-related efficacy end points with the use of <lb/>predefined end-point criteria, thereby maintain-<lb/>ing the scientific integrity of the trial.

All authors participated in the interpreta-<lb/>tion of the data and vouch for the accuracy and <lb/>completeness of the data and for the fidelity of <lb/>the trial to the protocol, available with the full <lb/>text of this article at NEJM.org. The first author <lb/>wrote the first draft. All authors participated in <lb/>manuscript development and made the decision <lb/>to publish the results. Agreements between the <lb/>sponsor of the trial, Pfizer, and the investigators <lb/>included data confidentiality. <lb/>Patients <lb/>Patients between 18 and 90 years of age were <lb/>eligible to participate in ATTR-ACT if they had <lb/>transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt <lb/>or ATTRm) confirmed by the presence of amyloid <lb/>deposits on analysis of biopsy specimens obtained <lb/>from cardiac and noncardiac sites (e.g., fat aspi-<lb/>rate, gastrointestinal sites, salivary glands, or <lb/>bone marrow) and, in patients without ATTRm, <lb/>by the presence of transthyretin precursor pro-<lb/>tein confirmed on immunohistochemical analy-<lb/>sis, scintigraphy, or mass spectrometry. Cardiac <lb/>involvement was confirmed by means of echocar-<lb/>diography, with an end-diastolic interventricular <lb/>septal wall thickness exceeding 12 mm; a history <lb/>of heart failure, with at least one prior hospital-<lb/>ization for heart failure or clinical evidence of <lb/>heart failure (without hospitalization) manifested <lb/>in signs or symptoms of volume overload or ele-<lb/>vated intracardiac pressures requiring treatment <lb/>with a diuretic for improvement; an N-terminal <lb/>pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level <lb/>greater than or equal to 600 pg per milliliter; and <lb/>a 6-minute walk-test distance exceeding 100 m. <lb/>Patients were excluded if any one of the fol-<lb/>lowing criteria was met: they had, in the opinion <lb/>of the investigator, heart failure that was not due <lb/>to transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy; New <lb/>York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart <lb/>failure; the presence of light-chain amyloidosis; <lb/>a history of liver or heart transplantation; an im-<lb/>planted cardiac device; previous treatment with <lb/>tafamidis; an estimated glomerular filtration rate <lb/>lower than 25 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-<lb/>surface area; or liver transaminase levels exceed-<lb/>ing two times the upper limit of the normal range. <lb/>Patients were also excluded if they had severe <lb/>malnutrition as defined by a modified body-mass <lb/>index (mBMI) of less than 600, calculated as the <lb/>serum albumin level in grams per liter multiplied <lb/>by the conventional BMI (the weight in kilograms <lb/>divided by the square of the height in meters), or <lb/>were receiving concurrent treatment with non-<lb/>steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, tauroursode-<lb/>oxycholate, doxycycline, calcium-channel block-<lb/>ers, or digitalis. <lb/>Trial Design <lb/>Patients were randomly assigned to receive 80 mg <lb/>of tafamidis, 20 mg of tafamidis, or matching <lb/>placebo once daily in ratio of a 2:1:2. Stratifica-<lb/>tion was conducted according to TTR status (vari-<lb/>ant or wild type) and baseline NYHA class. An <lb/>interactive Web-response system was used. The <lb/>trial duration was 30 months, and on completion <lb/>patients were offered enrollment in an extension <lb/>study. Patients who had adverse events that may <lb/>have been associated with treatment and may have <lb/>affected adherence to the dosing regimen or con-<lb/>tinued participation in the trial were given the <lb/>option to receive a reduced dose (patients receiving <lb/>a dose of 80 mg would instead receive a dose of <lb/>40 mg, and all others continued to receive the dose <lb/>assigned at randomization). <lb/>Analysis Populations <lb/>The modified intention-to-treat analysis included <lb/>all patients who were enrolled, received at least <lb/>one dose of tafamidis or placebo, with both pa-<lb/>tient and investigator unaware of group assign-<lb/>ment, and underwent at least one postbaseline <lb/>efficacy evaluation (i.e., postbaseline hospital-<lb/>ization, study visit, or death). The safety analysis <lb/>set included all enrolled patients who received at <lb/>least one dose of tafamidis or placebo. Because <lb/>all patients who were enrolled also fulfilled the <lb/>three other criteria of the modified intention-to-<lb/>treat analysis, this analysis was effectively also an <lb/>intention-to-treat analysis. <lb/>Outcomes <lb/>We hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, <lb/>followed by frequency of cardiovascular-related <lb/>hospitalizations over the course of the 30-month <lb/>trial. This analysis compared the results of a <lb/>pooled tafamidis (80 mg and 20 mg) treatment <lb/>group with the placebo group. Key secondary end <lb/>points were change from baseline to month 30 in <lb/>both distance walked on the 6-minute walk test, 20 <lb/>a measure of functional capacity, and the Kansas <lb/>City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Sum-<lb/>mary (KCCQ-OS) score, 21 which assesses quality <lb/>of life.

			<body>scores denoting poorer quality of life. Vital status <lb/>at month 30 was assessed for all enrolled patients. <lb/>Statistical Analysis <lb/>A sample size of 400 patients was estimated to <lb/>give the trial power of at least 90% to detect a <lb/>30% reduction in mortality, a reduction in the <lb/>frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitaliza-<lb/>tions from 2.5 to 1.5 (over the 30-month dura-<lb/>tion of the trial), or both given treatment with <lb/>tafamidis. Our trial population was targeted to <lb/>comprise at least 30% of patients with ATTRm <lb/>and at least 30% with ATTRwt. Comparisons were <lb/>based on the pooled tafamidis treatment groups of <lb/>80 mg and 20 mg versus placebo, except for spe-<lb/>cific dose comparisons. In the primary analysis, <lb/>we hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, fol-<lb/>lowed by frequency of cardiovascular-related hos-<lb/>pitalizations with the use of the Finkelstein-<lb/>Schoenfeld method, 22 which is based on the <lb/>principle that each patient in the clinical trial is <lb/>compared with every other patient within each <lb/>stratum in a pairwise manner. This method <lb/>gives a higher importance to all-cause mortality. <lb/>The pairwise comparison proceeds in hierarchi-<lb/>cal fashion, using all-cause mortality, followed by <lb/>frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitaliza-<lb/>tion when patients cannot be differentiated on <lb/>the basis of mortality. In the analysis of fre-<lb/>quency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization, <lb/>when two patients had different follow-up times, <lb/>the shorter follow-up time was used in compar-<lb/>Figure 1. Randomization, Evaluation, and Outcomes. <lb/>The most common reasons that screened patients were not admitted to the trial were as follows: closure of enroll-<lb/>ment (for patients with wild-type transthyretin protein), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level less than <lb/>600 pg per milliliter, clinical instability, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate lower than 25 ml per minute per <lb/>1.73 m 2 of body-surface area. Among patients assigned to receive tafamidis who did not complete the trial, 25 were <lb/>no longer willing to participate, 17 had adverse events, 6 underwent organ transplantation, 2 had implantation of a <lb/>cardiac mechanical assist device (CMAD), 1 was lost to follow-up, and 1 had a protocol violation. Among patients <lb/>assigned to receive placebo, 37 were no longer willing to participate, 11 had an adverse event, 5 underwent organ <lb/>transplantation, and 1 had a protocol violation. Vital status at 30 months was available and confirmed for all pa-<lb/>tients who underwent randomization. The numbers shown do not depict the death count for the purpose of pri-<lb/>mary analysis. Some reasons for discontinuation (i.e., heart transplantation and CMAD implantation) were treated <lb/>as death in the primary analysis.

			<body>ing the frequency of their cardiovascular-related <lb/>hospitalizations. <lb/>We applied the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method <lb/>to the patients stratified according to NYHA class <lb/>at baseline (class I or II vs. class III) and TTR <lb/>status (variant vs. wild-type), yielding four strati-<lb/>fication pools. Heart transplantation, heart and <lb/>liver transplantation, and implantation of a me-<lb/>chanical cardiac-assist device were treated as death <lb/>for the purposes of this analysis. Only one pa-<lb/>tient underwent liver transplantation alone, and <lb/>this event was not treated as a death. All-cause <lb/>mortality was analyzed with the use of a Cox <lb/>proportional-hazards model, with treatment and <lb/>the stratification factors treated as covariates. <lb/>We compared the frequency of cardiovascular-<lb/>related hospitalizations with the use of a Poisson <lb/>regression model, with treatment, TTR status (vari-<lb/>ant and wild type), NYHA baseline class (NYHA <lb/>classes I and II combined vs. NYHA class III), <lb/>treatment-by-TTR status interaction, and treat-<lb/>ment-by-NYHA baseline class interaction terms as <lb/>factors, with adjustment for treatment duration. <lb/>The key secondary end points were assessed with <lb/>the use of a mixed-effect model, repeated-mea-<lb/>sure approach and analysis of covariance, 23 with <lb/>an unstructured covariance matrix. Center and <lb/>patient-within-center were treated as random ef-<lb/>fects, and treatment, visit, TTR status (ATTRm <lb/>vs. ATTRwt), and visit-by-treatment interaction <lb/>were treated as fixed effects, with the baseline <lb/>value as covariate. A prespecified hierarchical <lb/>testing order (the 6-minute walk test, followed <lb/>by the KCCQ-OS) provided multiplicity protec-<lb/>tion against type 1 error.

			<body>[42.9%]; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.96). <lb/>According to the Poisson regression analysis, the <lb/>rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations <lb/>(0.48 vs. 0.70 hospitalizations per year; relative <lb/>risk ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.81) was lower <lb/>with tafamidis than with placebo (see Table S3 <lb/>in the Supplementary Appendix for post hoc <lb/>negative binomial analysis). Kaplan-Meier sur-<lb/>vival curves showed that tafamidis resulted in a <lb/>reduction in all-cause mortality, with the curves <lb/>diverging after approximately 18 months of treat-<lb/>ment (Fig. 2). Across prespecified subgroups, in-<lb/>cluding those based on TTR status (ATTRwt vs. <lb/>ATTRm), NYHA class (I or II vs. III), and tafam-<lb/>idis dose (80 mg vs. 20 mg), the difference in <lb/>all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovas-<lb/>cular-related hospitalizations favored tafamidis <lb/>over placebo, except in patients with NYHA class <lb/>III disease at baseline, among whom the rates of <lb/>cardiovascular-related hospitalizations were high-<lb/>er among patients receiving tafamidis than among <lb/>those receiving placebo (Fig. 3). Using a prespeci-<lb/>fied Poisson-regression analysis, we observed an <lb/>interaction between treatment and NYHA base-<lb/>line classification. We did not observe an inter-<lb/>action between treatment and TTR status. A pre-<lb/>specified sensitivity analysis of all-cause mortality <lb/>that did not treat transplantation involving heart <lb/>transplantation or implantation of a cardiac me-<lb/>chanical assist device as death yielded a hazard <lb/>ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.94). An additional <lb/>post hoc analysis of time to first cardiovascular-<lb/>related hospitalization is provided (see Fig. S1 in <lb/>the Supplementary Appendix). <lb/>Key secondary end points included the change <lb/>from baseline to month 30 in the distance walked <lb/>during the 6-minute walk test and in KCCQ-OS <lb/>score. Tafamidis reduced the decline in the dis-<lb/>tance walked during the 6-minute test as com-<lb/>pared with placebo (75.68 m [standard error, ±9.24; <lb/>P&lt;0.001]), with differences first observed at <lb/>month 6 (Fig. 4A). Tafamidis also reduced the <lb/>decline in the KCCQ-OS score as compared with <lb/>placebo (13.65 [standard error, ±2.13; P&lt;0.001]), <lb/>with differences first observed at month 6 (Fig. 4B). <lb/>Exploratory end points included a smaller in-<lb/>crease in the NT-proBNP level among patients <lb/>receiving tafamidis than among those receiving <lb/>placebo at months 12 and 30 (least-squares mean <lb/>difference, −735.14 [95% CI, −1249.16 to −221.13] <lb/>at 12 months and −2180.54 [95% CI, −3326.14 to <lb/>−1034.95] at 30 months).

			<body>crease in left ventricular stroke volume (least-<lb/>squares mean difference, 6.28), were noted at <lb/>month 30. <lb/>Safety and Adverse Effects <lb/>The safety profiles of tafamidis and placebo were <lb/>similar. There was no meaningful difference in <lb/>the safety of the two doses of tafamidis. Adverse <lb/>events that emerged during treatment were gen-<lb/>erally mild to moderate in severity, and perma-<lb/>nent discontinuation of tafamidis or placebo as <lb/>a result of adverse events was less common in <lb/>the tafamidis groups than in the placebo group <lb/>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Dose <lb/>reduction related to adverse events were uncom-<lb/>mon (two patients receiving tafamidis [0.8%] and <lb/>four patients receiving placebo [2.3%]). The results <lb/>of laboratory analyses related to safety did not <lb/>differ between the tafamidis and placebo groups. <lb/>Both diarrhea and urinary tract infections, ad-<lb/>verse events previously reported in patients with <lb/>familial amyloid polyneuropathy, 25 were less com-<lb/>mon in patients who received tafamidis than in <lb/>those who received placebo. The most frequent <lb/>adverse events are summarized in the Supplemen-<lb/>tary Appendix. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>ATTR-ACT showed that tafamidis is superior to <lb/>placebo in reducing the combination of all-cause <lb/>mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitaliza-<lb/>tions. The evidence also supports the assertion <lb/>that the risk of each component, when analyzed <lb/>independently of the other, is reduced. Tafamidis <lb/>was also associated with a significant reduction <lb/>in the decline in functional capacity (as measured <lb/>by the 6-minute walk test) and the decline in <lb/>quality of life (as measured by the KCCQ-OS) at <lb/>month 30, with differences first observed at <lb/>6 months. In contrast, the effect on overall sur-<lb/>vival emerged after approximately 18 months. This <lb/>dissociation between the effect on symptoms and <lb/>survival has also been observed with other thera-<lb/>pies for systolic heart failure in which ventricular <lb/>remodeling takes months to achieve. 26-28 <lb/>We observed a consistent benefit from tafam-<lb/>idis related to mortality across all subgroups. We <lb/>also observed fewer cardiovascular-related hos-<lb/>pitalizations among those who received tafamidis <lb/>across all subgroups, with the exception of those <lb/>with NYHA class III. We speculate that the high-<lb/>er hospitalization rate observed in this group is <lb/>attributable to longer survival during a more <lb/>severe period of disease, underscoring the im-<lb/>portance of early diagnosis and treatment of this <lb/>fatal, progressive disease, which can be difficult <lb/>to diagnose. 29 Given the progressive nature of the <lb/>disease and the mechanism through which tafam-<lb/>idis reduces amyloidogenesis -by specifically <lb/>Figure 4.

This approach is highly sensitive and <lb/>specific for the diagnosis of transthyretin amy-<lb/>loid cardiomyopathy 4,5,31 and can detect amyloid <lb/>deposits before an increase in left ventricular <lb/>wall thickness or the clinical syndrome of heart <lb/>failure and a rise in cardiac biomarkers has oc-<lb/>curred. 32,33 This method can even predict prog-<lb/>nosis. 5,34 Early identification and treatment are <lb/>now more likely given the availability of effective <lb/>diagnostic tools and therapy. <lb/>Similarly, innovative methods are being de-<lb/>veloped and used for research in rare disease. In <lb/>studies of rare disease such as transthyretin amy-<lb/>loid cardiomyopathy, small patient populations <lb/>often limit recruitment and hinder the conduct of <lb/>randomized trials. The Finkelstein-Schoenfeld <lb/>method, used in this trial, is a validated technique <lb/>that increases the sensitivity and power of the <lb/>analysis of smaller cohorts and prioritizes the <lb/>importance of mortality while also addressing <lb/>morbidity. <lb/>The overall incidence and type of adverse <lb/>events were similar in the tafamidis and placebo <lb/>groups. Discontinuation of the trial drug owing <lb/>to adverse events that occurred during treatment <lb/>was less common in patients who received ta-<lb/>famidis than in those who received placebo, and <lb/>dose reductions were uncommon and occurred <lb/>more often in the placebo group. <lb/>In conclusion, in patients with heart failure <lb/>due to transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, <lb/>treatment with tafamidis reduced all-cause mor-<lb/>tality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations <lb/>as compared with placebo. Tafamidis treatment <lb/>also significantly reduced the decline in func-<lb/>tional capacity and quality of life. These find-<lb/>ings indicate that tafamidis is an effective therapy <lb/>for patients with transthyretin amyloid cardio-<lb/>myopathy. <lb/></body>
