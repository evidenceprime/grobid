Blaiss, M.D.,* Eli O. Meltzer, M.D.,# M. Jennifer Derebery, M.D., § and <lb/>John M. Boyle, Ph.D. ¶ <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal <lb/>obstruction. Although the incidence of AR has been increasing, the reported prevalence of AR differs among surveys. Allergies <lb/>in America was a comprehensive national survey that included 2500 adults diagnosed with AR and 400 healthcare <lb/>practitioners who treat AR. Participants were interviewed about the burden of AR and comorbid conditions and the effect of <lb/>AR on productivity and quality of life. Approximately 43% of nasal allergy sufferers reported that their nasal allergies were <lb/>seasonal, and 56% indicated that their allergies were persistent throughout the year. Seasonal allergies were worse during the <lb/>spring and fall, as reported by 56 and 45% of sufferers, respectively. Nasal congestion was ranked as the most common symptom <lb/>experienced by patients daily or on most days during the worst month for nasal allergies. Patients and healthcare providers <lb/>indicated that nasal congestion was the most bothersome symptom of AR. Asthma was diagnosed in 20% of patients with AR. <lb/>Nasal allergy sufferers and healthcare providers indicated that nasal allergies affected productivity, led to missed workdays, and <lb/>had a negative effect on patient quality of life. Patients and healthcare professionals report that symptoms of AR are bothersome. <lb/>Effective treatment options for nasal symptoms of AR may decrease the burden of illness and improve patient productivity and <lb/>quality of life. <lb/>(Allergy Asthma Proc 28:S4 -S10, 2007; doi: 10.2500/aap.2007.28.2991) <lb/>Key words: Allergic rhinitis, burden of illness, comorbidity, epidemiology, intranasal corticosteroids, perspectives, <lb/>productivity, quality of life, sleep disturbance, symptoms <lb/></front>

			<body>A llergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory dis-<lb/>ease characterized by nasal itching, sneezing, <lb/>rhinorrhea, and nasal obstruction. 1 A significant num-<lb/>ber of AR patients also experience severe eye symp-<lb/>toms, 1 including eye itching, watering, and puffiness <lb/>(i.e., allergic conjunctivitis). The incidence of AR in-<lb/>creases from infancy, peaks in childhood and adoles-<lb/>cence, and decreases in the elderly. 2 An estimated <lb/>20 -40 million Americans may be affected with AR; <lb/>ϳ40% have perennial AR, 20% have seasonal AR, and <lb/>40% have perennial AR with seasonal exacerbations, <lb/>depending on the allergen sensitivity. 3 <lb/>The estimated prevalence of AR in the United States <lb/>ranges widely from 4 to Ͼ40%. 4 -9 However, the re-<lb/>ported prevalence and incidence of AR in the United <lb/>States vary, depending on the method of data collec-<lb/>tion. In addition, the population prevalence and inci-<lb/>dence of AR are not collected in national health sur-<lb/>veys such as the National Health Interview Survey and <lb/>the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-<lb/>vey. The National Health and Nutrition Examination <lb/>Survey (NHANES III) found that Ͼ50% of the popula-<lb/>tion tested positive to one or more allergens, and the <lb/>prevalence was 2.1-5.5 times higher than that deter-<lb/>mined in the NHANES II survey. 8,10 The American <lb/>Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology esti-<lb/>mates that Ͼ40 -50 million Americans suffer from al-<lb/>lergic diseases. 7 The National Health Interview Survey <lb/>estimates the rate of &quot;hay fever&quot; at 9%. 5 However, <lb/>according to the International Survey of Asthma and <lb/>Allergy in Children, the prevalence of &quot;hay fever&quot; has <lb/>been estimated at ϳ16%. 6 Furthermore, the Agency for <lb/>Healthcare Research and Quality has estimated a preva-<lb/>lence of AR at 10 -30% of adults and up to 40% of chil-<lb/>dren. 9 The wide variations in estimates among these sur-<lb/>veys may exist because of the differences in definitions of <lb/>the disease; variations in sampling time frames, as well as <lb/>differences in data-collection methods; or inclusion of a <lb/>low number of survey participants. <lb/>The Allergies in America survey was designed to use <lb/>robust data-collection methods to examine the burden <lb/>of AR in the adult population of the United States.

All rights reserved. <lb/>For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm <lb/>survey is the largest and most comprehensive national <lb/>survey to date. It was created to evaluate the burden of <lb/>AR and comorbid conditions and their effects on pro-<lb/>ductivity and quality of life. The other objective of the <lb/>survey was to compare patient and healthcare provider <lb/>perspectives on AR. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Allergies in America: A Survey of Nasal Allergy <lb/>Sufferers <lb/>The Allergies in America survey was composed of two <lb/>distinct surveys, each of which consisted of telephone <lb/>interviews with national randomly selected samples. <lb/>The National Survey of Nasal Allergy Sufferers. A na-<lb/>tional sample of adult patients with nasal allergies <lb/>was obtained by systematically screening 30,927 <lb/>households using a random-digit-dialing telephone <lb/>survey. During the telephone screening, an adult <lb/>member of each household was asked to report the <lb/>total number of adults in the household and the total <lb/>number of these individuals Ն18 years of age who <lb/>had been diagnosed with nasal allergies. Patients <lb/>Ն18 years of age who had been diagnosed by a <lb/>physician as having AR, nasal allergies, or &quot;hay fe-<lb/>ver&quot; and had been either taking medication for AR <lb/>or had AR symptoms during the past year were <lb/>included in the survey. Telephone interviews were <lb/>conducted between January 5 and January 31, 2006, <lb/>and averaged 34.8 minutes in length. <lb/>The National Survey of Healthcare Professionals. A par-<lb/>allel survey was conducted among 400 healthcare prac-<lb/>titioners, including a national sample of 300 physi-<lb/>cians. Telephone interviews were conducted with <lb/>national samples of three physician populations: adult <lb/>primary care, allergists, and otolaryngologists (100 in-<lb/>terviews were conducted in each of the three physician <lb/>strata). The adult primary care population was defined <lb/>as the medical specialties of general practice, family <lb/>practice, and internal medicine. The samples were <lb/>drawn as probability samples from the American Med-<lb/>ical Association and the American Osteopathic Associ-<lb/>ation Master List of physicians in the United States. <lb/>The samples were restricted to physicians in these <lb/>three specialty strata who were in active practice in <lb/>direct patient care in an outpatient setting. <lb/>A fourth stratum of nurse practitioners and phy-<lb/>sician assistants completed the national survey of <lb/>healthcare professionals. The nurse practitioner sample <lb/>was drawn from state licensing board lists. The physi-<lb/>cian assistant sample was drawn from the membership <lb/>list of the American Academy of Physician Assistants. <lb/>A total of 50 interviews were completed in each stra-<lb/>tum and were conducted by telephone using the same <lb/>survey instrument as the physician survey. The inter-<lb/>views were conducted between January 17 and Febru-<lb/>ary 14, 2006, and averaged 19.4 minutes in length. <lb/>The maximum expected sampling error for a simple <lb/>random sample of 2500 (e.g., the patient survey) was <lb/>Ϯ1.2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. <lb/>The maximum expected sampling error for a simple <lb/>random sample of 100 (e.g., primary care physicians) <lb/>was Ϯ9.8 percentage points at the 95% confidence <lb/>level. <lb/>The response and nonresponse rates were deter-<lb/>mined also. Screening interviews for survey eligibility <lb/>were successfully completed in 30,927 households. <lb/>Among the 2821 households with eligible respondents, <lb/>detailed interviews were completed in 2500 (35% men <lb/>and 65% women) households, which resulted in a <lb/>response rate of 88.6%. Weights consisting of cross-<lb/>tabulations and frequencies were used in all analyses <lb/>to determine critical survey outcomes. <lb/>Development of Survey Questionnaire. Schulman, <lb/>Ronca and Bucuvalas, Inc., and experts in the field of <lb/>AR collaborated to develop this questionnaire, which <lb/>would collect accurate and relevant information on <lb/>AR. Survey questions were developed through analy-<lb/>sis of the relevant literature and identification of ques-<lb/>tions used to study similar diseases in accepted health <lb/>surveys. The AR patient questionnaire focused on gen-<lb/>eral health, AR triggers, AR symptoms, effects of aller-<lb/>gies on quality of life, and the effectiveness and side <lb/>effects of nasal allergy medications. <lb/>Questions in the patient survey relevant to this pub-<lb/>lication are <lb/>1. Would you describe your nasal allergies as sea-<lb/>sonal, or do they occur throughout the year? <lb/>2. During what times of the year are your nasal aller-<lb/>gies the worst? <lb/>3. During the worst 1-month period of the past year, <lb/>did you have [symptom] every day, most days a <lb/>week, a few days a week, a few days a month, less <lb/>than that, or never? <lb/>4. Which of the following nasal allergy symptoms are <lb/>most bothersome to your patients? <lb/>5. Which of these symptoms was the most bother-<lb/>some to you? <lb/>6. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma? <lb/>7. Have you had asthma in the past 12 months? <lb/>8. During the last week have you had sinus prob-<lb/>lems, heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux dis-<lb/>ease, cold or flu, earaches, migraines, skin rashes, <lb/>fever, pink eye, or none of the above? <lb/>9. Do your nasal allergies keep you from working full <lb/>time? <lb/>10. On days when you had nasal allergy symptoms, <lb/>how much did the symptoms interfere with your <lb/>Allergy and Asthma Proceedings <lb/>S5 <lb/>Delivered by Ingenta to: Guest User IP: 37.9.46.93 On: Wed, 13 Jul 2016 03:50:55 <lb/>Copyright (c) Oceanside Publications, Inc.

Did the symptoms interfere <lb/>a lot, a moderate amount, some, only a little, or not <lb/>at all? <lb/>11. Have you missed work in the past 12 months be-<lb/>cause of your nasal allergies? <lb/>12. Thinking about your productivity on a scale of <lb/>0 -100, where 100 means 100% productivity, where <lb/>would you rank your productivity on days when <lb/>you do not have nasal allergy symptoms? <lb/>13. Where would you rank your productivity on the <lb/>same scale of 0 -100 when your nasal allergies are <lb/>at their worst? <lb/>The questions in the healthcare professional survey <lb/>relevant to this publication are <lb/>1. Do you classify the severity of nasal allergies in <lb/>patients? <lb/>2. What proportion of your patients with nasal aller-<lb/>gies would you classify as having seasonal rather <lb/>than perennial allergies? <lb/>3. Which of these symptoms was the most bothersome <lb/>to your patients? <lb/>4. For the average patient with AR, during allergy <lb/>season, would you say the condition impacted their <lb/>daily life a impacted their daily life a moderate <lb/>amount, impacted their daily life some, impacted <lb/>their daily life a little, or did not really impact their <lb/>daily life? <lb/>5. Thinking about productivity at work on a scale from <lb/>0 -100, where 100 means 100% productivity, where <lb/>would you rank the productivity of persons with <lb/>AR when their nasal allergies are at their worst? <lb/>Weights were developed to correct for sampling bias. <lb/>The weights corrected for differences between eligible <lb/>patients screened and eligible patients actually inter-<lb/>viewed. An age and gender correction was used to <lb/>adjust results from the interviewed population so that <lb/>they would be similar to those that would be expected <lb/>from the screened population of allergy sufferers. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Burden of AR on Patients <lb/>Yearly Pattern of Allergy Symptoms. Fourteen percent <lb/>of adults in the survey had a physician-confirmed di-<lb/>agnosis of AR and were symptomatic during the pre-<lb/>vious year of the study. This survey likely underre-<lb/>ports the overall population prevalence of the disease <lb/>because it does not include children or individuals <lb/>without a formal healthcare provider-confirmed diag-<lb/>nosis of AR. When asked whether their nasal allergies <lb/>were seasonal or persisted throughout the year, 43% of <lb/>nasal allergy sufferers reported that their allergies were <lb/>seasonal only, and 56% indicated that their allergies <lb/>occurred throughout the year (Table 1). Of those who <lb/>reported seasonal AR, 56% of patients indicated that <lb/>their allergies were worse during the spring season, <lb/>and 45% of patients reported that their allergies were <lb/>worse during the fall season. The majority (Ͼ58%) of <lb/>healthcare providers reported that they classified the <lb/>nasal allergies of their patients as seasonal or perennial. <lb/>Moreover, healthcare providers indicated that approx-<lb/>imately one-half of their patients suffered from sea-<lb/>sonal allergies. <lb/>Symptoms of AR. Stuffy nose was reported as the <lb/>most common symptom (60%) experienced by patients <lb/>daily or on most days during the worst month for nasal <lb/>allergies (Table 1). Other most frequently experienced <lb/>symptoms reported by patients during the worst <lb/>month for nasal allergies included repeated sneezing <lb/>(46%), postnasal drip (46%), and runny nose (45%). <lb/>Bothersome Symptoms and Severity. Nasal allergy suf-<lb/>ferers indicated stuffy nose (22%), headache (14%), <lb/>postnasal drip (14%), and itchy (10%) and watery (5%) <lb/>eyes as the most bothersome symptoms associated <lb/>with their nasal allergies (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, <lb/>the majority of healthcare providers reported that the <lb/>symptoms that are most bothersome to their patients <lb/>included nasal congestion (94%), postnasal drip (75%), <lb/>and runny nose (69%).

Healthcare providers indicated that <lb/>Ͼ60% of their patients had severe or moderate symp-<lb/>toms. Furthermore, the vast majority (Ͼ94%) of <lb/>healthcare providers indicated that the symptoms were <lb/>extremely or moderately bothersome to their patients. <lb/>Comorbid Conditions Associated with AR. When pa-<lb/>tients were asked whether they had been diagnosed <lb/>with asthma ever in the past or in the past 12 months, <lb/>68% indicated that they had never been diagnosed <lb/>with asthma previously. However, 20% of the patients <lb/>reported having been diagnosed with asthma in the <lb/>past 12 months (Table 2). Sinus problems were re-<lb/>ported to be associated with nasal allergies in about <lb/>one-half of the patients. Other comorbid conditions, <lb/>with the exception of heartburn, were infrequently re-<lb/>ported. <lb/>Burden of AR on Patient Productivity and Quality of Life. <lb/>Approximately one-third of patients reported that their <lb/>nasal allergies caused them to miss work (Table 3). <lb/>Thirty-five percent of patients indicated that their nasal <lb/>allergies moderately interfered with work. When al-<lb/>lergy symptoms were at their worst, the mean produc-<lb/>tivity was ϳ72%, indicating a decrease in productivity <lb/>of 23% during the allergy season from a mean produc-<lb/>tivity of 95% during the normal time of year.

All rights reserved. <lb/>For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm <lb/>affected daily lives to some or to a moderate extent in <lb/>51% of patients. Most healthcare providers (86%) be-<lb/>lieved that allergies affected the daily lives of their <lb/>patients. Moreover, healthcare providers indicated that <lb/>nasal allergies caused missed workdays in patients <lb/>with AR (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, all healthcare provid-<lb/>ers reported that nasal allergies affected patient pro-<lb/>ductivity at work (Fig. 2 B), suggesting adverse eco-<lb/>nomic consequences as a result of AR. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>Epidemiological evidence suggests that the preva-<lb/>lence of AR in the United States and around the world <lb/>is increasing. 4 However, it is difficult to achieve an <lb/>accurate and reliable estimate of the prevalence of AR <lb/>because of the wide variations among the sur-<lb/>veys. 5,6,9,10 The Allergies in America survey was de-<lb/>signed to overcome these variations by adopting opti-<lb/>mal data-collection methods and using a relatively <lb/>strict definition to estimate the burden of AR in the <lb/>United States. <lb/>Allergies in America, one of the largest and most com-<lb/>prehensive national surveys conducted about AR, sug-<lb/>gests that, based on patient and healthcare provider <lb/>perspectives, nasal allergies persist in many patients <lb/>throughout the year. Moreover, nasal allergy sufferers <lb/>and healthcare providers relate that nasal congestion is <lb/>the most bothersome symptom associated with nasal <lb/>allergies. The survey also notes that the bothersome <lb/>symptoms of AR decrease patient productivity and <lb/>reduce quality of life. In a 2005 Roper Public Affairs <lb/>and Media Internet survey of 1000 adults with aller-<lb/>gies, the majority of participants indicated that they <lb/>experienced allergy symptoms in the morning, with <lb/>nasal congestion reported to be the most common <lb/>symptom compared with other symptoms. 11 In an-<lb/>other large survey of 2355 individuals with AR, 85% of <lb/>individuals reported that they suffered from nasal con-<lb/>gestion, which affected their quality of life and produc-<lb/>tivity. 12 In a large population-based cross-sectional sur-<lb/>vey of 15,000 households, the most commonly reported <lb/>symptoms included runny nose, sneezing, nasal con-<lb/>gestion, and tiredness. 13 <lb/>In this survey, patient and healthcare provider per-<lb/>spectives indicate that nasal allergy symptoms, includ-<lb/>ing ocular symptoms, are bothersome to patients. Fur-<lb/>thermore, physicians are aware of the degree of <lb/>discomfort, particularly the bothersome symptoms, <lb/>that their patients experience during a nasal allergy <lb/>exacerbation. However, there were significant differ-<lb/>ences in patient and healthcare provider perceptions <lb/>regarding the extent of the most bothersome symptoms <lb/>of nasal allergies. Notably, bothersome symptoms <lb/>are the primary reason that contributes to AR being <lb/>among the 10 major reasons for primary care physician <lb/>visits. 14 In this survey, nasal allergy sufferers and <lb/>healthcare providers considered nasal congestion the <lb/>most bothersome symptom associated with nasal aller-<lb/>gies. Nasal congestion is also the most frequent symp-<lb/>tom of AR that significantly affects quality of life and <lb/>has been considered to contribute to sleep disturbances <lb/>in patients with AR. 15 <lb/>Nasal allergy symptoms are a major burden on pa-<lb/>tient quality of life and may negatively affect produc-<lb/>tivity. Therefore, quality-of-life instruments have been <lb/>developed to measure the effect of AR on patients. 16,17 <lb/>Generic and disease-specific questionnaires are the two <lb/>major types of quality-of-life instruments used in pop-<lb/>ulation surveys. Generic surveys are broad-based, re-<lb/>producible measurements that can assess quality of life <lb/>over all different disease states and conditions, treat-<lb/>ment interventions, and population states. The generic <lb/>Figure 2. Effect of nasal allergies on (A) work and (B) produc-<lb/>tivity among nasal allergy sufferers.

All rights reserved. <lb/>For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm <lb/>instrument used most often in AR studies is the Med-<lb/>ical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Sur-<lb/>vey (SF-36). 18 In contrast, disease-specific instruments <lb/>are more responsive than generic instruments and al-<lb/>low the researcher to evaluate important aspects of <lb/>quality relevant solely to the condition studied. The <lb/>disease-specific instrument used most frequently in AR <lb/>is the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire <lb/>(RQLQ). 19 Meltzer et al. have shown that patients with <lb/>AR had a poorer quality of life, established through <lb/>both generic (the SF-36) and specific (the Juniper Rhi-<lb/>noconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire) quality-<lb/>of-life instruments. 19 Using the SF-36 generic quality-<lb/>of-life instrument, Bousquet et al. compared quality of <lb/>life in patients with moderate to severe perennial AR <lb/>with patients with asthma of variable severity 20,21 and <lb/>reported that patients with AR had a poorer quality of <lb/>life than patients with asthma in numerous domain <lb/>measures such as social functioning, energy, mental <lb/>health, and limitations to both physical and emotional <lb/>problems. <lb/>A major adverse effect of AR is poor nighttime sleep, <lb/>which may lead to daytime drowsiness, fatigue, and <lb/>indecision and may also lead to significant impairment <lb/>in learning and cognitive function. 22-24 In this survey, <lb/>nasal allergy sufferers reported that their allergies in-<lb/>terfered with work and productivity, further indicating <lb/>that nasal allergy symptoms negatively affect patient <lb/>quality of life. Furthermore, all healthcare providers <lb/>recognized that AR has a negative effect on the pro-<lb/>ductivity of their patients who work. Indeed, the mean <lb/>decrease in total productivity (absenteeism and presen-<lb/>teeism) losses for AR have been reported at $593/ <lb/>employee per year. 25 In 2003, a study using 1996 data <lb/>estimated the direct costs of AR in the United States at <lb/>$3.4 billion/year. 26 In another study, which evaluated <lb/>indirect costs to business as a result of AR, the total <lb/>work loss was estimated at 3.6 million days, with costs <lb/>to employers of $445.3 million. 27 Moreover, AR results <lb/>in an estimated 2 million lost schooldays. 28 A timely <lb/>management of AR with appropriate therapy may lead <lb/>to a better quality of life and may improve patient <lb/>productivity. Because AR is a chronic disease, treat-<lb/>ment options should be effective throughout the year, <lb/>without evidence of tachyphylaxis. <lb/>The Allergies in America survey indicated that ap-<lb/>proximately one-third of patients with AR had been <lb/>previously diagnosed with concomitant asthma. AR <lb/>frequently precedes asthma and is a risk factor for the <lb/>development of asthma. 29 -31 In support of these re-<lb/>sults, a recent report by the American Academy of <lb/>Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology estimated that 38% <lb/>of patients with AR have asthma, and other studies <lb/>estimate that 60 -78% of patients with asthma have <lb/>been diagnosed with coexisting AR. 29,32 Notably, pa-<lb/>tients with asthma and concomitant AR have more <lb/>severe asthma than patients without AR. 29 Therefore, <lb/>effective treatment options for the upper airways may <lb/>decrease the burden of asthma in patients with con-<lb/>comitant AR. <lb/>In conclusion, the Allergies in America survey estab-<lb/>lishes that nasal allergy sufferers and healthcare pro-<lb/>vider perspectives are in concordance with regard to <lb/>the bothersome symptoms of AR. Effective treatment <lb/>options for the inflammatory process that results in AR <lb/>may decrease the burden of bothersome symptoms <lb/>and comorbidities of AR, thereby improving patient <lb/>productivity and quality of life. <lb/></body>
