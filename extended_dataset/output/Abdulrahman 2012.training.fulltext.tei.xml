			<p>T he prevalence of allergic diseases has been steadily increasing<lb/> worldwide to a point where the World Allergy Organization<lb/> estimates that 30-40% of the world population is now affected by one<lb/> or more allergic conditions. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> In fact, respiratory symptoms including<lb/> acute infections and long-term conditions such as asthma, rhinitis,<lb/> and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are currently, worldwide,<lb/> the most common reason for patient presentation to a primary care<lb/> provider requiring intervention. <ref type="biblio">1,2<lb/></ref> Although the exact cause for the worldwide increase in allergic<lb/> disorders has not been elucidated, it is clear that allergies are becom-<lb/>ing more complex and sufferers frequently experience more than one<lb/> symptom. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> Allergic rhinitis (AR), defined as an inflammatory condi-<lb/>tion of the nasal mucosa primarily mediated by an IgE-associated<lb/> response to ubiquitous indoor and/or outdoor environmental aller-<lb/>gens and characterized by nasal pruritus, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and<lb/> nasal congestion, in particular, is a very common chronic respiratory<lb/> disorder that affects between 10 and 30% (ϳ700 million people) of the<lb/> world population. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> The prevalence of AR has also been increasing<lb/> and now has become the most common chronic medical condition<lb/> worldwide requiring active intervention. <ref type="biblio">2</ref> What makes this statistic so<lb/> concerning is that AR is a known risk factor for asthma and has other<lb/> associated comorbidities that include sinusitis, nasal polyposis, con-<lb/>junctivitis, otitis media with effusion, upper respiratory infections,<lb/> and sleep disorders. <ref type="biblio">4,5</ref> In addition to the associated comorbidities, AR<lb/> has been shown to have a direct and significant impact on an indi-<lb/>vidual&apos;s quality of life (QOL) and have significant direct and indirect<lb/> costs. <ref type="biblio">6<lb/></ref> Poorly controlled AR can result in significant discomfort that can<lb/> impair productivity at work, performance in school, social interac-<lb/>tions, and sleep. <ref type="biblio">7-11<lb/></ref> Despite the epidemiological evidence showing a worldwide in-<lb/>crease in allergic disorders, a link to other comorbid conditions, and<lb/> significant impact on QOL, AR often goes undiagnosed or marginal-<lb/>ized as merely a nuisance by physicians and patients alike. In fact,<lb/> Valovirtra and colleagues reported more work productivity loss as-<lb/>sociated with AR than with several other chronic disorders including<lb/> depression, arthritis, migraines, and asthma. <ref type="biblio">12</ref> This point is under-<lb/>scored by a recent survey in Spain. The results showed that one-third<lb/> of survey participants were not aware that they had AR. In addition,<lb/> a physician diagnosis of AR was not made in nearly one-half of the<lb/> AR sufferers who participated in the survey. The survey concluded<lb/> that the lack of effective communication between health care provid-<lb/>ers and patients led to poor treatment adherence and increased pa-<lb/>tient reliance on multiple agents as well as over-the-counter (OTC)<lb/> products. <ref type="biblio">13<lb/></ref> In adults, once AR has been correctly diagnosed, effective treatment<lb/> has been shown to improve QOL and even lower the risk of devel-<lb/>oping asthma. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> However, to effectively manage AR and associated<lb/> QOL sequela, long-term use of medications that address the under-<lb/>lying inflammation will often be required. For this reason, current<lb/> international diagnostic and treatment guidelines recommend intra-<lb/>nasal corticosteroids (INCSs) as one of the most effective first-line,<lb/> long-term, treatment options for mild-to-moderate AR. <ref type="biblio">15-17</ref> INCS<lb/> treatments have been shown to ameliorate all symptoms associated<lb/> with AR and are particularly effective in improving nasal congestion<lb/> in the chronic AR sufferer. <ref type="biblio">18,19</ref> Second-line therapies may be recom-<lb/>mended in patients with moderate-to-severe disease and who are<lb/> either partially or unresponsive to INCS therapy. These include an-<lb/>tihistamines, decongestants, cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antago-<lb/>nists, immunotherapy, and nonpharmacologic therapies. <ref type="biblio">15<lb/></ref> Despite the numerous initiatives that are currently being under-<lb/>taken by various allergy organizations, a complete picture of the size<lb/> of the global allergy epidemic does not exist. Recently, several large-<lb/>scale surveys (e.g., Allergies in American Survey, Allergies in Latin<lb/> America, and Allergies in Asia Pacific) have attempted to further<lb/> clarify the prevalence of diagnosed AR, its impact on QOL, and<lb/> current treatment gaps in several regions of the world. <ref type="biblio">8,20-23</ref> Unfortu-<lb/>nately, no such studies or surveys have addressed the true burden of<lb/> AR in the Middle East. Therefore, the Allergies in Middle East Survey<lb/> (AIMES) was undertaken in an attempt to further clarify the preva-<lb/>lence of AR, its impact on QOL, existing treatment paradigms and<lb/> treatment gaps associated with AR, and the medications currently<lb/> used to treat this disease.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/> Allergies in Middle East Survey<lb/></head>

			<p>Included in this survey were adults, children, and adolescents Ն4<lb/> years old residing in Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the<lb/> United Arab Emirates. Survey entry criteria included individuals<lb/> with a physician diagnosis of AR who were currently experiencing or<lb/> being treated for AR. Because AR may not have been a common term<lb/> understood or communicated to patients in the countries where the<lb/> interviews took place, other terms were also used in this survey to<lb/> describe AR. Therefore, a list of synonymous terms was provided to<lb/> screened individuals to ensure that the survey captured everyone<lb/> with the targeted condition. However, for the purposes of clarity, the<lb/> term AR will be used in this article to identify patients included in this<lb/> survey. A total of 5098 households from Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi<lb/> Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates were screened either by phone<lb/> or at in-person interviews, depending on the most appropriate mode<lb/> of screening and interviewing in a particular country. Individual<lb/> in-person screens were conducted with 2313 individuals in Iran in<lb/> place of the household screen used elsewhere. A total of 7411 screen-<lb/>ings were conducted that yielded 501 completed surveys across all<lb/> countries (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). It is important to note that the population sur-<lb/>veyed and presented in this table were those individuals actually<lb/> diagnosed with AR by a physician.<lb/></p>

			<p>Fieldwork was conducted between July and October of 2011. Tele-<lb/>phone and in-person interviewing were used. Most of the interviews<lb/> were conducted in urban areas because of the low telephone pene-<lb/>tration and lack of interviewing infrastructure in rural areas of the<lb/> Middle East. The average length of interviews was 36.2 minutes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The survey was developed and conducted by Abt SRBI (New York,<lb/> NY), an international survey research organization. The survey spon-<lb/>sor was Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Osaka, Japan).<lb/></p>

			<p>The maximum expected sampling error for a simple random sam-<lb/>ple of 501 cases (e.g., all respondents in the Middle East region) would<lb/> be Ϯ4.38 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. The maxi-<lb/>mum expected sampling error for a simple random sample of 409<lb/> cases (e.g., the adult Middle East sample) would be Ϯ4.85 percentage<lb/> points at the 95% confidence level. The maximum expected sampling<lb/> error for a simple random sample for country-specific samples from<lb/> the Middle East survey would be Ϯ9.8 percentage points for sample<lb/> sizes of 100 at the 95% confidence level. It should be noted that<lb/> household sampling for in-person interviews was conducted with a<lb/> more complex design that used cluster sampling, so design effects<lb/> may increase actual sampling variance compared with simple ran-<lb/>dom sampling.<lb/></p>

			<head>Development of Survey Questionnaires<lb/></head>

			<p>Validated and standardized questionnaires specific to ascertaining<lb/> the prevalence, impact, and treatment gaps associated with AR, un-<lb/>fortunately, do not currently exist. Thus, through the use of survey<lb/> analysts from the research firm Abt SRBI, Inc., along with expert<lb/> physicians in the AR field from the Middle East, patient and health<lb/> care provider questionnaires were developed to accurately collect<lb/> relevant information on AR within the surveyed countries in the<lb/> Middle East. Questions included in this survey have been standard-<lb/>ized to survey questions previously used in previous surveys on<lb/> AR, <ref type="biblio">20,23-25</ref> which include thousands of survey participants across<lb/> North America, South America, and Asia. A complete list of survey<lb/> questions can be found in Appendix A.<lb/></p>

			<p>Copyright (c) Oceanside Publications, Inc. All rights reserved.<lb/> For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm<lb/> Survey questions were developed through analysis of relevant<lb/> literature and the identification of questions used in other health<lb/> surveys. The developed questionnaires focused on general health; AR<lb/> triggers and symptoms; effects of AR on QOL including sleep, impact<lb/> on daily life, mood, absenteeism, and presenteeism. Perceived effec-<lb/>tiveness, expectations of treatment outcome and side effects of OTC<lb/> (all medications available without a prescription), and prescription<lb/> AR medications were also assessed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Sample weights were developed to correct for sampling bias and<lb/> differences between eligible patients screened and eligible patients<lb/> actually interviewed. An age and gender correction ensured that the<lb/> interviewed population was similar to the screened population of<lb/> allergy sufferers. Cross-tabulation and frequency weighting was used<lb/> in all analyses to determine critical survey outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/> Demographics<lb/></head>

			<p>A complete overview of survey participant demographics is<lb/> provided in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. There were 409 adult participants (18-88 years<lb/> of age; mean, 35.0 Ϯ 11.6 years) and 92 children/adolescents (4-17<lb/> years of age; mean, 10.7 Ϯ 4.0 years). Of the 501 total survey<lb/> participants, roughly, 55% were female subjects. The majority of<lb/> respondents reported having secondary education at a university.<lb/> Nearly 75% of survey respondents indicated that they had private,<lb/> public, or both forms of health insurance to cover medical care<lb/> costs. The average age at which a physician diagnosed AR was<lb/> 20.5 Ϯ 12.3 years.<lb/></p>

			<p>Forty percent of participants were smokers and 24% owned a pet,<lb/> both known risk factors for respiratory diseases such as asthma and<lb/> AR. Fourteen percent of survey participants reported having been<lb/> diagnosed with asthma/chest allergy in addition to AR. The country<lb/> with the lowest reported proportion of adults with asthma/chest<lb/> allergy and AR was Iran (3%) whereas Lebanon had the highest<lb/> proportion (41%). A complete Middle East and country-specific<lb/> breakdown of AR respondents with physician-diagnosed asthma is<lb/> shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In respondents reporting asthma, 68% reported having<lb/> asthma symptoms or an asthma exacerbation within the past year.<lb/></p>

			<head>Prevalence and Patterns of Diagnosed AR in the<lb/> Middle East<lb/></head>

			<p>The AIMES found that 10% of respondents had a physician diag-<lb/>nosis of AR or equivalent (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The prevalence of diagnosed AR<lb/> ranged from 8% in Lebanon to 11% in Egypt. Overall, 73% of survey<lb/> participants reported being diagnosed with AR (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The majority (54%) of adult survey respondents reported being<lb/> diagnosed with AR by an otolaryngologist whereas primary care<lb/> providers (e.g., internal medicine and general practitioner/family<lb/> practice physicians) played a lesser role in the initial diagnosis of AR<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). After diagnosis, otolaryngologists were the most commonly<lb/> consulted health care provider for continued treatment of diagnosed<lb/> AR (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Overall, 46% of survey participants reported never<lb/> having had a diagnostic skin-prick test or blood test to confirm the<lb/> diagnosis of AR (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Two-thirds (65%) of those surveyed indicated that they suffer in-<lb/>termittently from AR and approximately one-third (30%) reported<lb/></p>

Intermittent allergies were<lb/> most prevalent in Saudi Arabia (79%) and Egypt (68%). Persistent AR<lb/> was most common among respondents from Lebanon (44%), Iran<lb/> (43%) and the United Arab Emirates (42%; Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>One noteworthy observation is that while nearly two-thirds<lb/> (65%) of respondents stated that their AR was intermittent in<lb/> nature, dust was the most commonly reported nonallergic trigger<lb/> for AR by 71% of respondents (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Other nonallergic triggers<lb/> commonly reported (Ͼ45% of respondents) were pollution, per-<lb/>fume, and tobacco smoke. When participants were asked during<lb/> what particular months of the year their AR was worst, spring and<lb/> fall months were commonly cited as being most troublesome (data<lb/> not shown).<lb/></p>

			<head>Symptoms Associated with AR in Middle East<lb/> Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>Individuals included in the AIMES were asked whether they still<lb/> suffer from AR or if their AR symptoms have diminished over time. The<lb/> overwhelming majority of respondents (98%) reported that they were<lb/> still troubled by their AR symptoms despite the fact that nearly all of<lb/> them (92%) reported taking a medication in the past 12 months to treat<lb/> their allergies (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). When asked about the type of AR symptoms<lb/> most commonly experienced, respondents cited runny nose (57%), nasal<lb/> itching (56%), nasal congestion (55%), throat itching (52%), reduced<lb/> sense of smell (51%), and postnasal drip (50%). A full breakdown of the<lb/> most commonly experienced AR symptoms during the worst 1-month<lb/> period for the overall survey population can be found in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Copyright (c) Oceanside Publications, Inc. All rights reserved.<lb/> For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm<lb/> With few exceptions, well over 50% of respondents from all coun-<lb/>tries experienced a full range of moderately to extremely bothersome<lb/> symptoms during AR attacks (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). Repeated sneezing and head-<lb/>ache were reported overall as the two most bothersome symptoms<lb/> during AR attacks (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Respondents with AR also reported a significant amount of dis-<lb/>comfort during attacks. Forty-nine percent said that the discomfort<lb/> during an allergy attack was such that they could not tolerate it<lb/> without relief.

			<head>Impact of Nasal Allergies on QOL in Middle East<lb/> Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>The impact of AR symptoms on QOL was also assessed. Respon-<lb/>dents were asked specifically how AR affected their life. Additionally,<lb/> the survey also included an assessment of AR symptoms on mood,<lb/> daily activities, productivity at work, absenteeism from work or<lb/> school, and sleep quality. Overall, 58% of respondents reported that<lb/> during the worst 1-month period of allergy symptoms, their daily life<lb/> was impacted at least moderately.

All rights reserved.<lb/> For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm<lb/> When asked how AR symptoms affected their mood when their AR<lb/> symptoms were most severe, survey respondents reported feeling<lb/> depressed (72%), tired (80%), or miserable (34%; Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). There was<lb/> also variability among the countries surveyed with considerable dif-<lb/>ferences noted particularly for Iran and Lebanon compared with the<lb/> overall survey population (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Activity limitations in daily life were reportedly affected signifi-<lb/>cantly by AR symptoms within the Middle East region. Collectively,<lb/> 72% of respondents reported work/school performance was impaired<lb/> at least somewhat by their AR symptoms (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). When specifically<lb/> asked how their AR symptoms affected their daily school/work<lb/> activities, over one-third (35%) reported that their AR interfered and<lb/> prevented them from performing their daily work/school activities<lb/> and caused them to miss work/school because of their disease (Table<lb/> <ref type="table">5</ref>). As a corollary question, survey participants were asked to actually<lb/> rate their work/school productivity/output on a percentage basis in<lb/> the presence and absence of severe AR symptoms. These data showed<lb/> that there was an overall mean work productivity decrease of 27%<lb/> when their AR symptoms were most severe. Results were fairly<lb/> consistent across all individual countries (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Roughly, 80% of the respondents reported that their sleep was<lb/> interfered with as a result of their AR symptoms. When the impact of<lb/> AR on these specific sleep indicators (getting to sleep, waking up<lb/> during night, and lack of a good night&apos;s sleep) was assessed, it was<lb/> surprisingly consistent across these three sleep measures for those<lb/> being quite a bit or extremely troubled (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Current Status of AR Control and Treatment in the<lb/> Middle East<lb/></head>

			<p>Eighty percent of the overall Middle East survey population re-<lb/>ported seeing a physician for their AR symptoms within the past year<lb/> with 55% of respondents reporting having seen a specialist at least<lb/> once (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). On the average, there were five physician visits per<lb/> year as a result of AR symptoms. Additionally, 22% reportedly visited<lb/> a pharmacy at least two times for advice about their AR symptoms in<lb/> the past 12 months (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>When asked how well their AR symptoms have been controlled<lb/> over the previous 4 weeks, less than one-half (40%) of respondents<lb/> assessed their AR symptoms as completely or well controlled (Table<lb/> <ref type="table">6</ref>). Furthermore, 15% of respondents assessed their AR symptoms as<lb/> poorly or completely uncontrolled (data not shown).<lb/></p>

			<p>The vast majority of these individuals (86%) took some kind of<lb/> prescription medication to treat their AR symptoms. The most com-<lb/>mon form of medication used by 76% to control AR symptoms was a<lb/> prescription nasal corticosteroid spray. Use of nasal corticosteroid<lb/> sprays ranged from a high of 95% in Iran to a low of 30% in Saudi<lb/> Arabia.<lb/></p>

			<p>When the use of desensitization methods (e.g., sublingual or sub-<lb/>cutaneous immunotherapy) was assessed, 42% of respondents said<lb/></p>

Although this<lb/> incidence may seem high, it is likely a function of survey participants<lb/> having to have had a physician diagnosis of AR to be included in the<lb/> survey. Use of this type of therapy ranged from a high of 57% in<lb/> Lebanon to a low of 19% in Saudi Arabia. A complete list of classes of<lb/> medications used to treat AR by Middle East survey respondents are<lb/> displayed in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>AR Treatment Expectations<lb/></head>

			<p>When survey participants were asked whether there were truly<lb/> effective treatments currently available to control their disease, only<lb/> 44% of respondents with AR agreed with this statement (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).<lb/> Fifty-five percent agreed that the frequency of AR symptoms could be<lb/> prevented in most cases (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>When asked to specifically define what they would perceive as a<lb/> successful outcome after treatment with an INCS, an overwhelm-<lb/>ing 91% thought that an INCS should provide relief of AR symp-<lb/>toms within 3 hours after administration (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). Surprisingly,<lb/> 86% thought that INCS products were supposed to provide relief<lb/> for Յ11 hours whereas only 3% of respondents thought that nasal<lb/> steroid sprays should last Ն18 hours (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). Respondents de-<lb/>fined a successful treatment outcome with an INCS product that<lb/> provides at least 82% symptom relief, has an onset of action of 2<lb/> hours, and provides symptom relief for up to 4 hours. When partici-<lb/>pants were asked about safety, 60% thought that INCS products are safe<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Prescription Nasal Steroid Spray Use and Treatment<lb/> Satisfaction in the Middle East<lb/></head>

			<p>The majority (83%) of survey participants cited using an INCS<lb/> product at some point over the past year to control their AR symp-<lb/>toms (Table <ref type="table">8</ref>). The major reasons cited for lack of use were related to<lb/> lack of severe symptoms, dislike of nasal sprays, and concern over<lb/> dependence. Side effects were provided as a reason by 7% of this<lb/> group (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>When respondents reporting that they had used an INCS product<lb/> within the past year were asked for the most important reason for<lb/> choosing an INCS, 40% responded that they were looking for fast<lb/> symptom relief and 21% were looking for long-lasting or complete<lb/> symptom relief (Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). When actual efficacy was assessed, 80% of<lb/> respondents stated INCS products gave them relief from most or all<lb/> AR symptoms (Table <ref type="table">8</ref>). When these same individuals were asked<lb/> about INCS efficacy over time, a significant portion (41%) stated that<lb/> their INCS lost effectiveness over the course of the day or night (data<lb/> not shown). In fact, most (49%) felt that the duration of effectiveness<lb/> was Ͻ4 hours. Moreover, 41% of respondents who had taken nasal<lb/> steroid sprays reported that the effectiveness tended to wear off after<lb/> initiating therapy (Table <ref type="table">8</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Nearly two-thirds (64%) rarely, if ever, changed their nasal<lb/> steroid spray once they started taking the medication; however, the<lb/> range across the individual countries was quite large. For example,<lb/> 88% of respondents from Iran reported that they rarely, if ever,<lb/> changed their INCS product, whereas only 37% of respondents<lb/> from Egypt cited that they rarely, if ever, changed their ICS prod-<lb/>uct. A nearly equal number of respondents (38%) from Egypt also<lb/> said they change their nasal steroid spray several times a year,<lb/> which is much higher than respondents reported from other coun-<lb/>tries (Table <ref type="table">8</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>When individuals who reported changing their INCS within the<lb/> last year were asked to provide a reason for changing, the majority<lb/> (47%) stated that the doctor changed their therapy. This was espe-<lb/>cially prevalent in Egypt where 69% of those respondents who<lb/> changed their INCS did so at the suggestion of the physician.<lb/> Smaller percentages of respondents reported their INCS change<lb/> being driven by lack of efficacy (27%) or waning of efficacy over<lb/> time (24%). Nearly one in three respondents (29%) stated that their<lb/> reason for switching INCS was because they wanted to try some-<lb/>thing else with the most common reason related to lack of effec-<lb/>tiveness.

A complete break-<lb/>down of reasons provided can be found in Table <ref type="table">8</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>When respondents were asked why they discontinued INCS treat-<lb/>ment, the most common reason cited was bothersome side effects. A<lb/> full analysis of the reasons for discontinuation for the overall data set<lb/> as well as by country is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the fact that side effects played an important role in discon-<lb/>tinuation, this survey attempted to elucidate the severity and types of<lb/> side effects experienced with INCS treatment. For those experiencing<lb/> side effects from nasal steroid sprays, Ն60% reported them as mod-<lb/>erately or extremely bothersome (Table <ref type="table">8</ref>). Side effects such as drip-<lb/>ping down throat, bad taste, drying feeling, burning, uncomfortable<lb/> spray volume, crusting, drowsiness, and headaches were commonly<lb/> reported and occurred with Ն60% of the INCS products they had<lb/> used (Table <ref type="table">8</ref>). Interestingly, when asked specifically about side ef-<lb/>fects and if they occurred with some or all INCS products it appears<lb/> that survey participants perceived a difference among the products<lb/> they had used. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> provides an overview of these results in the<lb/> surveyed Middle Eastern population.<lb/></p>

			<p>When asked about overall satisfaction with INCS products, 39% of<lb/> INCS users cited being very satisfied and 55% cited being at least<lb/> somewhat satisfied with their INCS product. When this satisfaction<lb/> rate was compared with other prescription and nonprescription prod-<lb/>ucts to treat AR, it was shown to be significantly greater than the 23%<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>The data presented from AMES show that nearly 7% of the sur-<lb/>veyed population had physician-diagnosed AR. Although other pub-<lb/>lications have higher estimated incidences, <ref type="biblio">3</ref> it is important to keep in<lb/> mind that this study was not a true prevalence study, but rather<lb/> assessed the proportion of the population who were diagnosed with<lb/> AR. Reassuringly, the data presented here are consistent with previ-<lb/>ously published estimates of diagnosed AR in the United States,<lb/> Canada, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific regions when a physician<lb/> diagnosis of AR and active symptoms or treatment for AR in the past<lb/> year were used as a clinical validation of the self-reported health<lb/> condition. <ref type="biblio">20,23,25,26<lb/></ref> In addition to obtaining an understanding of incidence of AR<lb/> diagnosis, the data presented here also assessed the type, frequency,<lb/> and impact of the symptoms on patients. These data showed that the<lb/> vast majority of respondents reported that their allergies and associ-<lb/>ated symptoms were intermittent in nature and that otolaryngologists<lb/> or allergists were instrumental in the diagnosis of AR. Moreover, the<lb/> type of symptoms experienced by AR suffers as well as the impact on<lb/> their daily lives was highly concordant with other studies. <ref type="biblio">8,10,25-27<lb/></ref> It is well established that AR has a profound and far-reaching impact<lb/> on the sufferer&apos;s QOL, resulting in significant limitations in daily activ-<lb/>ities, social functioning, and work performance. <ref type="biblio">20,28-33</ref> The data pre-<lb/>sented provide additional support to this concept in that almost all<lb/> patients with diagnosed AR reported that their condition had some<lb/> impact on their daily private and professional lives. These data support<lb/> findings from Valovirtra and colleagues who reported greater work<lb/> productivity loss associated with AR than with many other chronic<lb/> disorders including depression, arthritis, migraine, and asthma. <ref type="biblio">34<lb/></ref> Sleep impairment is another significant problem for patients with<lb/> inflammatory disorders of the upper respiratory tract such as AR. <ref type="biblio">28<lb/></ref> However, the impact of AR on sleep quality remains an underrecog-<lb/>nized component of AR morbidity. <ref type="biblio">35-40</ref> Nasal congestion, the most<lb/> bothersome AR symptom identified in this survey, has been associ-<lb/>ated with sleep-disordered breathing and sleep impairment. <ref type="biblio">9,27</ref> This is<lb/> highly concordant across all countries surveyed giving the authors<lb/> confidence that these overall findings were not spurious but repre-<lb/>sentative of a concomitant condition associated with AR. Moreover,<lb/> these data are in line with other published articles pertaining to the<lb/> relationship between impaired sleep quality and uncontrolled<lb/> AR <ref type="biblio">10,29,41,42</ref> and will add to the growing data set of literature regard-<lb/>ing the profound impact that AR has on sleep.<lb/></p>

			<p>The frequent and often times burdensome symptoms of AR along<lb/> with impaired sleep can also have a significant effect on allergy<lb/> sufferers&apos; lives and work productivity evident in the form of absen-<lb/>teeism and presenteeism. <ref type="biblio">33,43-45</ref> According to the data presented here,<lb/> when AR symptoms are most severe, there is an appreciable decrease<lb/> in productivity. These presenteeism data were highly concordant<lb/> with data from the Allergies in America Survey as well as recently<lb/> published data from Latin America. <ref type="biblio">20,24,25</ref> As with the sleep data<lb/> presented here, data on work productivity in the Middle East signif-<lb/>icantly contributes to the body of evidence showing the far-reaching<lb/> consequences of AR.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another important aspect of AIMES was the data obtained related<lb/> to treatment patterns and the role of AR medications in treatment of<lb/> AR. Surprisingly, these data showed that the majority of participants<lb/> had seen a physician, in most instances a specialist, within the past<lb/> year for their AR, suggesting that AR sufferers will actively seek<lb/> therapeutic solutions to their symptoms, especially when access is not<lb/> limited by out-of-pocket payment. Not surprisingly, given the<lb/> amount of physician intervention, nearly all individuals in the survey<lb/> reported having taken some type of prescription medication to treat<lb/> their disease with the majority taking an INCS product. This makes<lb/> sense considering that the majority of respondent&apos;s AR was being<lb/> managed by specialists including otolaryngologists and allergists<lb/> who are likely to follow published AR guidelines recommending<lb/> INCS products as first-line therapy.<lb/></p>

			<p>The data have shown that over 75% of survey respondents reported<lb/> taking an INCS within the last 4 weeks before the survey. Although<lb/> this incidence of use may seem high, it is important to recognize that<lb/> this survey population were those that had a physician diagnosis of<lb/> AR and, by extension, were likely to be treated for their disease.<lb/> Responses from survey participants confirm expectations that INCS<lb/> products will provide a high level of amelioration of their nasal<lb/> symptoms. Overall, when asked the expected overall percentage<lb/> symptom relief after taking an INCS product, respondents expected<lb/> this medication to alleviate the vast majority of their AR symptoms in<lb/> order for them to consider a treatment to be successful. Considering<lb/> the efficacy of INCS products, nearly all individuals who had taken<lb/> an INCS product in the past reported being somewhat to completely<lb/> satisfied with their INCS treatment. Because INCS products are con-<lb/>sidered the gold standard for AR treatment, it is critical to maximize<lb/> compliance and persistence to maximize the chance of treatment<lb/> success. In this regard, the current study identified specific reasons<lb/> why participants discontinued their INCS product. Major reasons<lb/> cited included lack of 24-hour symptom control, diminution of effect<lb/> with chronic use, and side effects related to unpleasant sensory attri-<lb/>butes associated with some INCS products (e.g., unpleasant smell,<lb/> large volume of spray, and throat run down).<lb/></p>

			<p>Although the AIMES provides important information, it is inher-<lb/>ently limited because information on allergy testing is lacking for 46%<lb/> of participants included in the survey (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Additionally, the<lb/> majority of participants were college educated and lived in urban<lb/> areas, which bias the survey results and therefore results can not be<lb/> generalized to the entire Middle East region. Furthermore, symptoms<lb/> reported by participants may easily be seen in individuals with<lb/> chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent rhinosinusitis or upper respiratory<lb/> tract infections. This could potentially lead to misdiagnosis of AR<lb/> when, in fact, the individual has rhinosinusitis. This is especially<lb/> likely because the majority of patients were evaluated by an ear, nose,<lb/> and throat specialist and not an allergist (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, data from the AIMES have identified the impact of AR<lb/> on individuals with this chronic disease and has identified a number of<lb/> treatment paradigms and treatment gaps that currently exist in the<lb/> Middle East. It is the authors&apos; belief that these data will contribute to a<lb/> better understanding of the true burden of AR and, in turn, provide the<lb/> basis for physicians to provide better education to patients about their<lb/> condition and treatment options, which could, in turn, ultimately lead to<lb/> better treatment outcomes for patients with AR.<lb/></p>
