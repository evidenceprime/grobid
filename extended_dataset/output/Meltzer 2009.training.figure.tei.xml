ENT, Ear, nose, and throat specialist;<lb/> OTO, otolaryngologist.<lb/> (43%) were made by the child&apos;s pediatrician (Fig 1, B). Interest-<lb/>ingly, the pediatricians surveyed estimated that among 95 patients<lb/> (4-17 years of age) seen on average each week (Fig 1, C), 24% (n<lb/> 5 23) of patients had AR. These physician estimates of AR prev-<lb/>alence are similar to those reported by family practice physicians<lb/> (29%), as well as by NPs and PAs (27%). Ear, nose, and throat<lb/> specialists estimated that 44% of their patients 4 to 17 years of<lb/> age had AR; allergists estimated that 67% of patients seen each<lb/> week had AR (Fig 1, D).</figDesc>

In addition, the Interna-<lb/>tional Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC)<lb/> study used a survey for the diagnosis of asthma and allergies<lb/> without diagnostic follow-up. The NHANES and ISAAC data<lb/> sets are used routinely in the medical literature to estimate the<lb/> prevalence of both asthma and AR. Although documenting IgE<lb/> sensitization would have contributed to the strength of the data by<lb/> validating the survey&apos;s ability to appropriately diagnose nasal<lb/> allergy in pediatric patients, the authors believe that the approach<lb/> used in the Pediatric Allergies in America survey (as well as the<lb/> ISAAC and NHANES surveys) is in line with current clinical<lb/> practices for an accurate diagnosis of AR. Because parental report<lb/> of nasal allergy symptoms is what physicians typically rely on in<lb/> the clinical care of children, whether in an office visit or a<lb/> telephone survey, the authors believe that the lack of an HCP-<lb/>validated diagnosis is not an insurmountable limitation of this<lb/> survey.</figDesc>
