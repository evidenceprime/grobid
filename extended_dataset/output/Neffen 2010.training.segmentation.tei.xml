Wingertzahn, Ph.D. 9 <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Allergies in Latin America is the first cross-national survey that describes the symptoms, impact, and treatment of nasal allergies <lb/>(NAs) in individuals Ն4 years old in Latin America (LA). In total, 22,012 households across the Latin American countries of <lb/>Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela were screened for children, adolescents, and adults with <lb/>a diagnosis of NA and either symptoms or treatment in the past 12 months. A total of 1088 adults and 457 children and adolescents <lb/>were included and the sample was probability based to ensure valid statistical inference to the population. Approximately 7% of the <lb/>LA population was diagnosed with NAs with two of three respondents stating that their allergies were seasonal or intermittent in <lb/>nature. A general practice physician or otolaryngologist diagnosed the majority of individuals surveyed. Nasal congestion was the <lb/>most common and bothersome symptom of NAs. Sufferers indicated that their symptoms affected productivity and sleep and had a <lb/>negative impact on quality of life. Two-thirds of patients reported taking some type of medication for their NAs, with a roughly equal <lb/>percentage of patients reporting taking over-the-counter versus prescription medications. Changing medications was most commonly <lb/>done in those reporting inadequate efficacy. The most common reasons cited for dissatisfaction with current medications were related <lb/>to inadequate effectiveness, effectiveness wearing off with chronic use, failure to provide 24-hour relief, and bothersome side effects <lb/>(e.g., unpleasant taste and retrograde drainage into the esophagus). Findings from this cross-national survey on NAs have confirmed <lb/>a high prevalence of physician-diagnosed NAs and a considerable negative impact on daily quality of life and work productivity as <lb/>well as substantial disease management challenges in LA. Through identification of disease impact on the LA population and further <lb/>defining treatment gaps, clinicians in LA may better understand and treat NAs, thus leading to improvements in overall patient <lb/>satisfaction and quality of life. <lb/>(Allergy Asthma Proc 31:S9 -S27, 2010; doi: 10.2500/aap.2010.31.3347) <lb/>Key words: Allergic rhinitis, efficacy, intranasal corticosteroids, nasal allergies, nasal allergy medications, produc-<lb/>tivity, quality of life, safety, sleep, survey <lb/>A llergic rhinitis (AR), a chronic inflammatory dis-<lb/>ease of the upper airways, is characterized by <lb/>nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal obstruc-<lb/>tion. 1 AR is considered to be one of the most prevalent <lb/>chronic conditions affecting children and adults and its <lb/>prevalence continues to increase worldwide. However, <lb/>the prevalence appears to be increasing at a higher rate <lb/>in Latin America (LA) compared with other regions <lb/>according to the comparison between Phase I and <lb/>Phase III of the International Study of Asthma and <lb/>Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) survey. 2,3 <lb/>AR, considered a nuisance by many, has been stud-<lb/>ied with great exuberance over the past years to ascer-<lb/>tain the true burden of disease. Recent studies have <lb/>shown that AR is associated with increases in school <lb/>and work absenteeism and presenteeism (reduced pro-<lb/>ductivity at work). 4,5 Additionally, it has been shown <lb/>to impair health-related quality of life and impose a <lb/>considerable economic burden on the health care sys-<lb/>tem. 6 -9 Furthermore, studies have shown that subjects <lb/>with poorly controlled AR can also suffer from sleep <lb/>disturbances, chronic fatigue, learning impairment, de-<lb/>creased energy, anxiety, and diminished social interac-<lb/>tion. 5,6,10,11 <lb/>To effectively manage AR and associated quality of life <lb/>sequela, AR often requires the chronic use of medications <lb/>From the 1 Respiratory Medicine Unit, Children&apos;s Hospital &quot;Orlando Alassia,&quot; Santa <lb/>Fe, Argentina, 2 Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Sao Paulo Medical <lb/>School, Brazil, 3 Division of Allergy, Clinical Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, <lb/>Federal University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, 4 Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martín, <lb/>Buenos Aires University, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 5 Universidad Autonoma de Me ´x-<lb/>ico, Mexico City, Mexico, and Mexican Association for Respiratory Care, Mexico City, <lb/>Mexico, 6 Head and Neck Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology Department, Hospital Ange-<lb/>les de las Lomas, Mexico City, Mexico, 7 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, <lb/>Mexico City, Mexico, 8 Schulman, Ronca, and Bucuvalas, Inc., New York, New York, <lb/>and 9 Nycomed GmbH, Florham Park, New Jersey <lb/>H.E.

			<body>that address the underlying cause of the disease and do <lb/>not necessarily take into consideration palliative issues. <lb/>Current therapeutic approaches for the treatment of AR <lb/>include antihistamines, decongestants, leukotriene mod-<lb/>ifiers, and intranasal corticosteroids (INCS). Although <lb/>oral antihistamines are an effective first-line pharmaco-<lb/>logic treatment for intermittent or mild persistent AR, <lb/>they do not adequately address the underlying compo-<lb/>nent of the disease, viz., inflammation. Moreover, sedat-<lb/>ing antihistamines can have deleterious side effects in-<lb/>cluding sedation, impaired cognitive function, and <lb/>cardiac arrhythmias. 12-14 INCS, by contrast, are regarded <lb/>as the most effective first-line therapy for patients with <lb/>moderate to severe AR because they reduce localized <lb/>inflammation within the nasal mucosa, thereby eliminat-<lb/>ing the underlying inflammatory cause of the dis-<lb/>ease. 9,15,16 Interestingly, however, data suggest that pa-<lb/>tients may not be satisfied with these agents because of, <lb/>in large part, perceived efficacy and safety concerns in <lb/>addition to undesirable side effects that lead to poor <lb/>medication adherence and compliance. 17-21 Concern <lb/>about adverse events and limited knowledge regarding <lb/>international guidelines for rhinitis management may, in <lb/>part, explain why primary care physicians and pediatri-<lb/>cians prescribe unusually low volumes of INCS agents in <lb/>LA. 22 Although several large-scale studies and surveys <lb/>(e.g., Allergies in America survey), have attempted to <lb/>ascertain the true prevalence of nasal allergies (NAs), its <lb/>impact on quality of life and current treatment gaps <lb/>within the United States and European Union, 6,18,23,24 no <lb/>such studies or surveys have addressed the true burden <lb/>of NAs in LA. Therefore, the Allergies in Latin America <lb/>survey was undertaken in an attempt to further clarify <lb/>the prevalence of physician-diagnosed NAs, its impact on <lb/>quality of life, existing treatment paradigms and treat-<lb/>ment gaps associated with NAs, and the medications <lb/>currently used to treat this disease. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Allergies in Latin America Survey <lb/>Persons targeted for this survey included children and <lb/>adolescents between the ages of 4 and 18 years as well as <lb/>adults aged Ն18 years old residing in one of eight Latin <lb/>American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, <lb/>Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela) who were cur-<lb/>rently experiencing or being treated for NAs after having <lb/>been diagnosed by a physician as having AR or NAs. A <lb/>total of 457 interviews were completed with parents of <lb/>NA sufferers 4 -18 years of age and a total of 1088 inter-<lb/>views were completed with adults having current NAs <lb/>across the eight countries. <lb/>Fieldwork was conducted between February and April <lb/>of 2008 and during which both telephone and in-person <lb/>interviews were conducted. Most of the interviews were <lb/>completed in urban areas because of the low telephone <lb/>penetration and lack of interviewing infrastructure in the <lb/>rural areas of LA. The average interview length was 41 <lb/>minutes. The survey was developed and conducted by <lb/>ABT SRBI, an international survey research organization. <lb/>The survey sponsor was NYCOMED, a research-based <lb/>pharmaceutical company. <lb/>The maximum expected sampling error for a simple <lb/>random sample of 1088 cases (e.g., the adult Latin Amer-<lb/>ican sample) would be ϩ3.0 percentage points at the 95% <lb/>confidence level. The maximum expected sampling error <lb/>for a simple random sample of 457 cases (e.g., the pedi-<lb/>atric Latin American sample) would be ϩ4.6 percentage <lb/>points at the 95% confidence level. The maximum ex-<lb/>pected sampling error for a simple random sample for <lb/>country-specific samples from the Latin American survey <lb/>would be ϩ5.7 percentage points for sample sizes of 300, <lb/>ϩ9.8 percentage points for sample sizes of 100, and ϩ13.9 <lb/>percentage points for sample sizes of 50, at the 95% <lb/>confidence level. It should be noted that household sam-<lb/>pling for face-to-face interviews is conducted in a more <lb/>complex design using cluster sampling so design effects <lb/>may increase actual sampling variance compared with <lb/>simple random sampling. <lb/>A high-level overview of the study design and <lb/>breakdown of the number of households screened <lb/>and surveyed can be found in Table 1 for the adults <lb/>and Table 2 for children and adolescents. It is im-<lb/>portant to note that the population surveyed and <lb/>presented in these two tables was diagnosed with <lb/>AR or NA by a physician. <lb/>Development of Survey Questionnaires <lb/>Because validated and standardized questionnaires <lb/>specific to ascertaining the prevalence, impact, and <lb/>treatment gaps associated with NAs did not exist at the <lb/>time of the survey, the research firm Schulman, Ronca, <lb/>and Bucuvalas, Inc., along with expert physicians in <lb/>the AR field from LA collaborated to develop patient <lb/>and health care professional questionnaires that would <lb/>accurately collect relevant information on NAs within <lb/>the Latin American Countries surveyed. Survey ques-<lb/>tions were developed through analysis of relevant lit-<lb/>erature, identification of questions used to study sim-<lb/>ilar diseases in accepted health surveys, and review of <lb/>pertinent questions developed for two previous stud-<lb/>ies supported by NYCOMED. 4,25 The developed ques-<lb/>tionnaires focused on general health, NA triggers, NA <lb/>symptoms, effects of allergies on quality of life, NA <lb/>medications, their effectiveness, and side effects. <lb/>AR questionnaires were reviewed, edited, and ap-<lb/>proved by a panel of AR experts. Weights were devel-<lb/>oped to correct for sampling bias and differences be-<lb/>tween eligible patients screened and eligible patients <lb/>actually interviewed.

Among <lb/>Latin American countries surveyed, Peru and Venezu-<lb/>ela reported the highest prevalence of NAs and Argen-<lb/>tina reported the lowest prevalence of diagnosed NAs. <lb/>A complete breakdown of the prevalence of AR across <lb/>the eight countries can be found in Fig. 1. <lb/>A large majority of adults with diagnosed NAs <lb/>across all eight countries reported having seasonal or <lb/>intermittent NAs rather than NAs occurring through-<lb/>out the year. Adults with NAs in Peru reported the <lb/>highest rate of seasonal allergies whereas Ecuador re-<lb/>ported the lowest rate of seasonal allergies. The reason <lb/>for the low rate to seasonal allergies in Ecuador is <lb/>likely ascribed to the minimal seasonal variation in this <lb/>region. <lb/>Equally, the majority of parents of children and ad-<lb/>olescents with NAs across all eight countries reported <lb/>that their children&apos;s and adolescents NAs were sea-<lb/>sonal or intermittent rather than occurring throughout <lb/>the year. Parents of children and adolescents with NAs <lb/>in Mexico reported the highest rate of seasonal aller-<lb/>gies whereas the parents of children and adolescent&apos;s <lb/>with NAs in Argentina reported the lowest rate of <lb/>seasonal allergies (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, de-<lb/>spite nearly two-thirds of respondents stating that their <lb/>allergies were seasonal or intermittent in nature, the <lb/>major allergy trigger reported by survey participants <lb/>was dust, a typical perennial allergen due to the high <lb/>level of mite-related antigens (73% of adults and 74% <lb/>of children and adolescents surveyed). <lb/>With regard to diagnosis of disease, the majority of <lb/>adult survey respondents reported having been diag-<lb/>nosed with NAs by their general practice physician <lb/>(37%) or an otolaryngologist (29%). Other physicians <lb/>making the first diagnosis of NAs included allergists <lb/>(13%), pediatricians (6%), pulmonologists (4%), family <lb/>practice physicians (2%), internists (1%), dermatolo-<lb/>gists (1%), and others (7%). A similar pattern was <lb/>observed in the child respondents (20% diagnosed by <lb/>their general practice physician and 20% having been <lb/>diagnosed by their otolaryngologist). The majority of <lb/>individuals who were surveyed reported that they had <lb/>the diagnosis of NA confirmed by a skin-prick test, a <lb/>blood test, or both (57% of adults and 61% of children <lb/>and adolescents surveyed). <lb/>When survey participants were asked to rate their <lb/>general health and other concomitant conditions, 31% <lb/>adult participants and 33% of pediatric participants <lb/>reported an overall health rating of poor to fair or poor. <lb/>When asked about other concomitant medical condi-<lb/>tions, essentially one-quarter of adults, adolescents, <lb/>and children included in the survey reported having <lb/>been diagnosed with asthma. Adult participants were <lb/>also asked what concomitant conditions they experi-<lb/>enced within the past 4 weeks after a NA exacerbation. <lb/>Nearly 50% reported suffering from the cold or flu <lb/>(47%) followed closely by migraine headaches (41%). <lb/>Over one-third reported having sinusitis or gastro-<lb/>esophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related symptoms <lb/>(33 and 30%, respectively). The most frequently occur-<lb/>ring concomitant conditions in adolescents and chil-<lb/>dren, like in the adults, were cold or flu (52%) followed <lb/>by migraine headaches (31%). Sinusitis and GERD-<lb/>related symptoms were reported less frequently in <lb/>children and adolescents compared with adults (26% <lb/>versus 33% and 30% versus 13%, respectively). A com-<lb/>plete breakdown of the most frequently occurring <lb/>health-related conditions during or after an NA exac-<lb/>erbation reported in adults, children, and adolescents <lb/>with NAs are displayed in Fig. 3, A and B. <lb/>Symptoms Associated with AR and NAs in Latin <lb/>American Patients <lb/>Adults with NAs in LA were asked about the fre-<lb/>quency with which they experienced specific symp-<lb/>toms. Overall, more than one-half of them reported <lb/>that they experienced nasal congestion every day or <lb/>most days when their NAs were most severe. Addi-<lb/>tionally, nearly one-half reported nasal itching (49%) <lb/>and repeated sneezing (47%) on all or most days in <lb/>their worst month. A similar pattern emerged in chil-<lb/>dren and adolescents with NAs. A full descriptive <lb/>breakdown of the most bothersome symptoms re-<lb/>ported by children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed <lb/>with NAs are displayed in Fig. 4, A and B. <lb/>Patients with NAs reported a significant amount of <lb/>discomfort during NA attacks.

The greatest <lb/>discomfort was found in Argentineans where 71% of <lb/>adults surveyed reported that they could not tolerate <lb/>their allergy symptoms without relief. With the excep-<lb/>tion of Brazil (39%), more than one-half of the adult <lb/>NA sufferers surveyed in the other countries reported <lb/>that they could not tolerate their NA symptoms with-<lb/>out relief. Similarly, the majority of parents of children <lb/>and adolescents with NAs in LA (53%) said that the <lb/>discomfort their children and adolescents experience <lb/>during an allergy attack is so severe that they can not <lb/>tolerate it without relief. Like in the adults with NAs, <lb/>the greatest discomfort was found in Argentinean chil-<lb/>dren and adolescents where 69% of those surveyed re-<lb/>porting that they could not tolerate their allergy symp-<lb/>toms without relief.

Almost <lb/>all patients with NAs reported that the condition had <lb/>an impact on their daily life when NA was at its worst. <lb/>To this end, one-half of the adults surveyed reported <lb/>that NAs affected their lives to at least a moderate <lb/>degree. Similarly, almost all parents of children and <lb/>adolescents with NAs reported that the disease had <lb/>some impact on their child&apos;s daily life when symptoms <lb/>were most severe. Forty-one percent of children and <lb/>adolescents reported having their daily life impacted to <lb/>at least a moderate degree when their NAs were at <lb/>their worst. <lb/>When adults were asked to identify specifically how <lb/>NAs impacted their daily activities, they reported they <lb/>were limited to some degree in having pets; exercising; <lb/>and engaging in social, family, and outdoor activities. <lb/>Figure 3.

All rights reserved. <lb/>For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm <lb/>When adults of children and adolescents with NAs <lb/>were asked about activity limitations resulting specif-<lb/>ically from their child&apos;s NAs, they reported that their <lb/>children and adolescents were limited in playing <lb/>sports, outdoor activities, having pets, and going out <lb/>with friends. <lb/>It is well recognized that NAs can affect a patient&apos;s <lb/>sleep quality. As such, the Allergies in Latin America <lb/>survey attempted to quantify sleep impact among NA <lb/>patients. In the adult portion of the survey, 44% of <lb/>sufferers reported being greatly troubled by at least <lb/>one sleep indicator (e.g., falling asleep, awakening dur-<lb/>ing the night, and perception of lack of restful night <lb/>sleep). Similarly, 45% of children and adolescents suf-<lb/>fering from NAs reported being greatly troubled by at <lb/>least one of the aforementioned sleep indicators. <lb/>Aside from physical symptoms, NAs can affect the <lb/>mood and feelings of those that suffer from them. <lb/>Fatigue associated with NAs was reported as the most <lb/>frequent mood disorder followed closely by irritability. <lb/>Depression was the third most frequent mood disorder <lb/>experienced by adult allergy sufferers in LA (Fig. 5). <lb/>Likewise, in children and adolescents, fatigue due to <lb/>NA was the most frequently experienced mood disor-<lb/>der, followed by frequent irritability and frequent de-<lb/>pression (Fig. 5). <lb/>One important way in which NAs can impact an <lb/>individual&apos;s daily life is the degree to which it can <lb/>interfere with allergy sufferers&apos; ability to work. Nearly <lb/>two of five (37%) adults with NAs in LA reported <lb/>having missed work or having their job performance <lb/>affected by their NAs in the past 12 months (Fig. 6). <lb/>When survey participants were asked to rate their <lb/>work productivity with and without allergy symp-<lb/>toms, adults reported their mean work productivity <lb/>when experiencing severe NAs was reduced by one-<lb/>third compared with when they experienced no symp-<lb/>toms (Fig. 6). Interestingly, these results were highly <lb/>concordant across all countries surveyed in that re-<lb/>spondents in the individual countries consistently re-<lb/>ported at least a 30 percentage point difference in their <lb/>work productivity when experiencing NAs at their <lb/>worst compared with when they were symptom free. <lb/>By contrast, over one-half of the parents of children <lb/>and adolescents with NAs in LA reported that their <lb/>adolescents and children had missed school or had <lb/>their school performance affected by their NAs in the <lb/>past 12 months (Fig. 6). Similar to the adults with NAs, <lb/>parents of children and adolescents with NAs in LA <lb/>cited a one-third loss in school productivity when their <lb/>child&apos;s NAs were at their worst compared with when <lb/>they were symptom free (Fig. 6). <lb/>Need for Treatment of AR and NA Symptoms and <lb/>Current Treatment Gaps <lb/>Most NA sufferers in LA are taking some kind of <lb/>medication for their condition. Nearly one-half of <lb/>adults with NAs reported using over-the-counter <lb/>(OTC) medications for their allergies and a nearly iden-<lb/>tical number reported taking some type of prescription <lb/>NA medication within the past 4 weeks. Only one in <lb/>four reported using a prescription nasal spray to con-<lb/>trol their NA symptoms in the past 4 weeks (Fig. 7 A). <lb/>Interestingly, although most children and adolescents <lb/>with NAs in LA were taking some kind of medication <lb/>for their condition, the difference between OTC use <lb/>and prescription use varied considerably compared <lb/>with the adult population.

A similar percentage of <lb/>parents of children and adolescents with NAs reported <lb/>rarely, if ever, changing their children&apos;s and adoles-<lb/>cents&apos; NA medications (76%). Interestingly, Ecuador <lb/>reported the highest percentage (21%) of adults who <lb/>change their medicine several times a year. Those NA <lb/>sufferers in LA who have changed their NA medica-<lb/>tion were asked to specify the reason for changing their <lb/>medication. The most common reason for changing <lb/>medications was that the medication was not ade-<lb/>quately effective (39%). The second most common rea-<lb/>son was because their doctor wanted to try something <lb/>else (23%). A similar pattern emerged when parents of <lb/>children and adolescents with NAs were surveyed. <lb/>Interestingly, in both populations, cost and issues <lb/>around cost were not a major reason for switching NA <lb/>medications. <lb/>Figure 6.

All rights reserved. <lb/>For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm <lb/>The issue of dissatisfaction with NA medications was <lb/>also addressed in this survey. Adults reported lack of <lb/>effectiveness (67%), effectiveness wearing off with <lb/>chronic use (16%), lack of 24-hour relief (13%), and <lb/>bothersome side effects (12%) as the most common <lb/>reasons for dissatisfaction. A similar pattern emerged <lb/>with children and adolescents in that 67% of parents <lb/>cited poor effectiveness as a reason for dissatisfaction <lb/>followed by lack of 24-hour relief (26%), effectiveness <lb/>wearing off with chronic use (19%), and bothersome <lb/>side effects (13%). <lb/>Treatment Paradigms and Treatment Gaps with <lb/>Prescription Nasal Sprays <lb/>Because prescription nasal sprays, especially cortico-<lb/>steroid sprays, are considered the most effective agents <lb/>available to treat NAs, the survey focused on current <lb/>treatment paradigms as well as treatment gaps with <lb/>these agents. As previously discussed, 25% of adults <lb/>and 30% of parents of children and adolescents with <lb/>NAs reported taking some kind of prescription NA <lb/>medication within the last 4 weeks. When adult survey <lb/>participants were asked why they had not taken a <lb/>prescription nasal spray for their NAs the majority <lb/>responded that they did not take a prescription nasal <lb/>spray because they did not have any symptoms (26%). <lb/>Other responses in descending order of frequency <lb/>were physician never prescribed this type of medica-<lb/>tion (22%), do not like nasal sprays (14%), and lack of <lb/>severe enough symptoms (13%). <lb/>When asked about the relief experienced with pre-<lb/>scription nasal sprays, two-thirds of adults with NA <lb/>reported that their prescription nasal spray gave them <lb/>relief from all or most of their NA symptoms. By <lb/>contrast, only a small minority (3%) reported that they <lb/>received no relief whatsoever after taking their pre-<lb/>scription nasal spray. A similar pattern emerged with <lb/>adults of children and adolescents with NA (data not <lb/>shown). <lb/>Because efficacy appeared to be the main driver in <lb/>patient dissatisfaction, the Allergies in Latin America <lb/>survey attempted to elucidate the concerns related to <lb/>efficacy as it specifically pertained to prescription nasal <lb/>sprays. When adult prescription nasal spray users <lb/>were asked whether their spray provided adequate <lb/>24-hour relief, over one-third (35%) of adult users re-<lb/>ported that their current prescription nasal spray lost <lb/>effectiveness over the course of the day and night. <lb/>Interestingly, in Ecuador the region where prescription <lb/>nasal spray was the lowest, 50% of nasal spray users <lb/>reported that their prescription nasal spray lost effec-<lb/>tiveness over the course of the day also. A similar <lb/>pattern emerged for surveyed parents of children and <lb/>adolescents diagnosed NAs (data not shown). <lb/>In addition to prescription nasal sprays loosing ef-<lb/>fectiveness over the course of the day, the reduction in <lb/>effectiveness with chronic use was also assessed. When <lb/>adult users of prescription nasal sprays were asked <lb/>whether they had ever found the continuing effective-<lb/>ness of their prescription nasal spray wearing off with <lb/>chronic use, nearly one in three (27%) reported having <lb/>experienced diminished effectiveness of their prescrip-<lb/>tion nasal spray when taken over a long period of time. <lb/>A nearly identical pattern emerged in those adults <lb/>surveyed with children and adolescents with NAs. <lb/>Another driver of dissatisfaction with NA medica-<lb/>tions was unpleasant side effects. When the specific <lb/>types of side effects experienced by users of prescrip-<lb/>tion nasal sprays were assessed, the majority of re-<lb/>ported bad taste and retrograde drainage into the <lb/>esophagus as being associated with their NA medica-<lb/>tion. Other side effects reported by adult NA suffers <lb/>are displayed in Fig. 8 A. Similar patterns of side effects <lb/>emerged for children and adolescents and are dis-<lb/>played in Fig. 8 B. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>Nasal allergies are generally recognized as the most <lb/>common chronic respiratory disorder worldwide. <lb/>However, prevalence estimates for the adult popula-<lb/>tion suffering from NAs in LA are currently lacking. <lb/>Although one study, the ISAAC, attempted to estimate <lb/>the prevalence of AR in LA, these estimates are limited <lb/>to two age cohorts (6 -7 years and 13-14 years) and are <lb/>based on 12-month prevalence of symptoms re-<lb/>sponded by the patient that suggest allergies by the <lb/>symptoms and not a physician diagnosis as was the <lb/>case in the survey presented here. 3 By contrast Allergies <lb/>in Latin America is based on a physician diagnosis of the <lb/>nasal allergies. The Allergies in Latin America survey <lb/>is the first study in the Latin American population <lb/>conducted with the sole purpose of ascertaining the <lb/>prevalence, symptoms, impact, and treatment of NAs <lb/>in children, adolescents, and adults in LA. This study <lb/>has uncovered a substantial negative impact of NAs on <lb/>quality of life and has identified a number of treatment <lb/>paradigms along with and, perhaps more importantly, <lb/>the treatment gaps that currently exist in the treatment <lb/>of this common chronic condition. In addition, it dif-<lb/>fered from the ISAAC survey in that ISSAC is based <lb/>solely on questionnaires, responded to by the patient, <lb/>that suggest allergies by their symptoms. By contrast <lb/>Allergies in Latin America is based on a physician diag-<lb/>nosis of the nasal allergies. <lb/>Prevalence data in this survey has shown that NA is <lb/>a common and chronic disease in LA as it is elsewhere <lb/>in the world. 26 The overall prevalence of diagnosed <lb/>NAs obtained from this survey was on average 6.6% <lb/>across all eight Latin American countries surveyed. <lb/>Interestingly and unexpectedly, this prevalence data <lb/>was substantially lower than that published in the <lb/>Allergy and Asthma Proceedings <lb/>S17 <lb/>D O <lb/>N O <lb/>T <lb/>C O <lb/>P Y <lb/>Delivered by Ingenta to: Guest User IP: 91.238.82.168 On: Fri, 15 Jul 2016 11:41:42 <lb/>Copyright (c) Oceanside Publications, Inc. All rights reserved. <lb/>For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm <lb/>ISAAC study in which the total prevalence was 27.9 <lb/>and 37.6% for the 6-to 7-year-old group and the 13-to <lb/>14-year-old group, respectively, in the last 12 months. <lb/>Additionally, these data also were substantially lower <lb/>when compared with their prevalence in North Amer-<lb/>ica (14% in the United States and 20% in Canada, <lb/>respectively), when using the same criteria of a physi-<lb/>cian diagnosis of AR or NAs as a clinical validation of <lb/>the self-reported health condition. 6,27 By these criteria, <lb/>those respondents who mentioned that they had NAs <lb/>or AR but chose to self-treat rather than see a physi-<lb/>cian, because of the cost of a physician visit, were not <lb/>included in the overall prevalence estimates. Hence, it <lb/>is important to recognize that these apparent discor-<lb/>dant prevalence estimates do not necessarily mean that <lb/>NAs are less common in LA, but rather that the rates of <lb/>physician diagnosis of the condition are likely different <lb/>or that the level of subdiagnoses of AR is high in Latin <lb/>American countries in comparison with the United <lb/>States and Canada. It is important mention that the <lb/>social economics status, insurance types, and health <lb/>care availability varies significantly across the different <lb/>countries of LA. As such, it is not without reason to <lb/>conclude that this could, in part, provide a rationale for <lb/>the variations in NA prevalence among countries <lb/>within LA. However, in the authors, opinions these <lb/>differences are unlikely to be the major factor driving <lb/>the varying prevalence estimates across the various <lb/>Latin American countries surveyed. Rather, the socio-<lb/>economic differences are likely a direct driver of the <lb/>differences between OTC and prescription NA use <lb/>across the different countries as outlined later in this <lb/>Discussion. <lb/>Despite the comparatively low prevalence of physi-<lb/>cian-diagnosed NAs within LA compared with else-<lb/>where in the world, reassuringly, the types of symp-<lb/>toms experienced by NA suffers as well as the impact <lb/>on their daily lives was highly concordant with other <lb/>studies reporting the impact on quality of life and <lb/>treatment gaps that currently exist in the treatment of <lb/>NAs. For example, the most bothersome symptoms <lb/>reported by NA suffers within LA included nasal con-<lb/>gestion, runny nose, postnasal drip, itching eyes, head-<lb/>aches, watering eyes, and repeated sneezing. These <lb/>most bothersome symptoms, especially nasal conges-<lb/>tion, were consistent with those reported by individu-<lb/>als in other studies. 1,9,22,24 <lb/>It is well established that NA has a profound impact on <lb/>the sufferer&apos;s quality of life. Not only do people with NAs <lb/>complain of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, itch-<lb/>ing, and associated eye problems, but they also have <lb/>impaired emotional well-being and social functioning. 6 <lb/>Additionally, data have shown that nasal congestion, the <lb/>most prominent (and bothersome according to this sur-<lb/>vey) symptom in NAs, is associated with sleep-disor-<lb/>dered breathing. 28 Sleep-disordered breathing secondary <lb/>to NA has been shown to have a profound effect on <lb/>mental health, including increased psychiatric disorders, <lb/>depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse. 6,10,11,29,30 Further-<lb/>more, sleep-disordered breathing in childhood and ado-<lb/>lescence is associated with increased disorders of learning <lb/>performance, behavior, and attention. 31 The data pre-<lb/>sented here are also concordant with data published by <lb/>others. These data have shown that almost all patients <lb/>with NAs reported that the condition had some impact <lb/>on their daily lives. Additionally, the most common <lb/>Figure 8.

The two primary com-<lb/>ponents of work productivity are absenteeism and pre-<lb/>senteeism. Absenteeism represents the number of days/ <lb/>hours missed from work because of the illness, whereas <lb/>presenteeism refers to illness-related reductions in per-<lb/>formance while the person is at work. Although NA does <lb/>not contribute to a large extent to absenteeism in the <lb/>workplace or school, it does have a large impact on <lb/>presenteeism. 6,40,41 According to data from the Allergies <lb/>in Latin America survey presented here, employed pa-<lb/>tients with NA have their productivity falling by over <lb/>33% on average between days when they have no allergy <lb/>symptoms and days when their allergy symptoms are at <lb/>their worst. A similar pattern emerges when parents <lb/>were asked to rate their children&apos;s and adolescent&apos;s pro-<lb/>ductivity in school. Interestingly, these data were consis-<lb/>tent with the data from the Allergies in America survey, <lb/>which showed a 23% reduction in adult productivity, and <lb/>a 30% decrease in productivity in children. 6,25 Addition-<lb/>ally, these data underscore the significant degree to <lb/>which NA can impact work performance as well as the <lb/>large, but hitherto unmeasured, economic consequences <lb/>of NAs in LA. <lb/>In addition to examining the prevalence, symptoms, <lb/>and burden of NAs in LA, the current survey also ad-<lb/>dressed the role of NA medications in the treatment of <lb/>NAs, including patient perspectives on both the effective-<lb/>ness and the bothersome side effects associated with <lb/>these medications. Almost all NA sufferers said that dis-<lb/>comfort during an allergy attack could not be ignored, <lb/>with 53% of patients stating that the discomfort is some-<lb/>thing that they can not tolerate without relief. Relief is <lb/>sought through prescription and OTC medications. The <lb/>majority of adult patients (67%) have used some medica-<lb/>tion for their NAs in the past 12 months, with nearly an <lb/>identical split between OTC and prescription agents. <lb/>There was nearly a 2:1 ratio of children and adolescents <lb/>receiving prescription versus OTC medications to treat <lb/>their disease. Interestingly, only one in four adult patients <lb/>and one in three children and adolescents used a pre-<lb/>scription nasal spray within the past 12 months within <lb/>LA. Surprisingly, despite the differences in health care <lb/>system and insurance coverage between LA and the <lb/>United States, the pattern of prescription versus OTC <lb/>medication use was surprisingly similar with 50% of <lb/>adults in the Allergy in America survey reporting that <lb/>they had used some type of OTC medication and 45% <lb/>reporting some type of prescription use within the past 12 <lb/>months. It is important to note, however, that appreciably <lb/>more patients in the United States reported taking a pre-<lb/>scription nasal spray (36%) compared with survey re-<lb/>spondents in LA (24%). The reasons for not taking a <lb/>prescription NA sprays were in part related to their dis-<lb/>satisfaction with related sensory attributes as well as the <lb/>fact that they only perceive the need for a prescription <lb/>nasal spray in the most serious of cases and mild-to-<lb/>moderate disease is not perceived to require such potent <lb/>agents, as well as the fact that primary care physicians <lb/>and pediatricians within LA typically use oral antihista-<lb/>mine with decongestants to manage the nasal blockage <lb/>instead of using nasal INCS as the Allergic Rhinitis and <lb/>its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) recommends. 22 One other <lb/>reason that could explain the differences in OTC versus <lb/>prescription NA use in LA could be related to the socio-<lb/>economic differences and insurance coverage among in-<lb/>dividuals across the various Latin American countries <lb/>surveyed. It is worthy of mention that nasal antihista-<lb/>mine use was essentially not reported in this survey <lb/>because of the fact that these agents are not readily avail-<lb/>able in LA. Therefore, it is not without reason to conclude <lb/>that if these agents were readily available and accepted in <lb/>LA, the prescription uses may well have increased. <lb/>Treatment gaps were also addressed with current NA <lb/>therapies in LA. These data showed that patients rarely, if <lb/>ever, changed allergy medications once they were pre-<lb/>scribed them. However, among those that did change <lb/>NA medications, the major reason cited for changing <lb/>their medication was related to lack of efficacy. When we <lb/>looked specifically at the prescription nasal spray seg-<lb/>ment, the lack of efficacy was specifically related to lack <lb/>of 24-hour control of symptoms as well as diminution of <lb/>effect with chronic use. These results were very similar to <lb/>the results in the Allergies in America survey in which <lb/>37% of those participants reporting dissatisfaction with <lb/>NA medications cited they were dissatisfied due to lack <lb/>of adequate effectiveness. 42 <lb/>Another driver of dissatisfaction with NA medications, <lb/>specifically prescription nasal sprays, was unpleasant <lb/>side effects. When the types of side effects experienced <lb/>with prescription nasal sprays were assessed, the major-<lb/>ity of users reported bad taste and retrograde drainage <lb/>Allergy and Asthma Proceedings <lb/>S19 <lb/>D O <lb/>N O <lb/>T <lb/>C O <lb/>P Y <lb/>Delivered by Ingenta to: Guest User IP: 91.238.82.168 On: Fri, 15 Jul 2016 11:41:42 <lb/>Copyright (c) Oceanside Publications, Inc.

These data were concordant with <lb/>the data obtained in the Allergies in America survey as <lb/>well as other studies that looked at sensory attributes that <lb/>patients found unpleasant. In one study by Mahedevia <lb/>and colleagues, sensory attributes of INCS sprays were <lb/>evaluated to assess which attributes influence patients&apos; <lb/>willingness to adhere to therapy. They found that lack of <lb/>aftertaste was the most important attribute, followed by <lb/>aftertaste, throat rundown, and nose runout. 20 These data <lb/>suggest that patient preference may be an important <lb/>driver in increasing patient acceptance and adherence to <lb/>NA medications. <lb/>In conclusion, a better understanding of the true <lb/>burden of NAs and NAs by physicians and patients in <lb/>addition to better education of patients about their <lb/>condition and treatment options is an important step in <lb/>any medical treatment regimen. Thus, the information <lb/>obtained from the Allergies in Latin America survey <lb/>pertaining to prevalence, impact on quality of life, and <lb/>treatment gaps now enable physicians within LA to <lb/>better describe the true burden of disease to patients, <lb/>which should lead to better patient education and, <lb/>ultimately, to better treatment outcomes for sufferers <lb/>of NAs and AR. <lb/></body>
