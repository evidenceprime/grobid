			<body>Introduction <lb/>The increasing prevalence of allergic respiratory diseases is <lb/>well documented [1,2]. Allergic rhinitis has the highest <lb/>prevalence [3], affecting an average of 24% of the European <lb/>population [1]. Eighty percent of asthma patients and 80% <lb/>of children with atopic dermatitis [4] suffer from allergic <lb/>rhinitis. Clinical trials have documented the severity of <lb/>allergic rhinitis and its impact on quality of life [5]. A <lb/>new classification of allergic rhinitis was proposed in the <lb/>Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guide-<lb/>lines based on severity and duration rather than causality <lb/>[6]. Complications of allergic rhinitis and concomitant <lb/>diseases are well documented, such as acute and chronic <lb/>sinusitis, recurrence of nasal polyps, otitis media/otitis <lb/>media with effusion, hearing impairment, abnormal cra-<lb/>niofacial development, sleep apnea, aggravation of under-<lb/>lying asthma, and increased propensity to develop asthma <lb/>[7 ]. Daytime fatigue, learning impairment, decreased <lb/>overall cognitive functioning, and decreased long-term <lb/>productivityhave alsobeen attributedto allergicrhinitis[8]. <lb/>Allergic rhinitis, especially persistent allergic rhinitis <lb/>(PER), is a serious debilitating disease. However, there <lb/>is still doubt among regulatory agencies and health payers <lb/>about how serious allergic rhinitis is. The use of over-the-<lb/>counter drugs is common in allergy sufferers [9]. As costs <lb/>are shifted away from insurers to patients, the risk of <lb/>denying patients, access to effective, comprehensive, and <lb/>physician-supervised disease management is growing. <lb/>Patient involvement in the management of allergic rhi-<lb/>nitis is important. Knowledge of patients&apos; perceptions of <lb/>their disease and its consequences are scarce; so, we <lb/>evaluated the impact of allergic rhinitis on the lives of <lb/>allergy sufferers and assessed the success of its manage-<lb/>ment. Aware that many sufferers of allergic rhinitis are <lb/>undiagnosed and unaware of their disease [9], we chose to <lb/>survey self-reported allergic rhinitis patients who are <lb/>members of European allergy patient organizations <lb/>(www.efanet.org). Thus, our survey reflects the know-<lb/>ledge and experience of motivated and self-conscious <lb/>allergy sufferers. <lb/>The questionnaire we chose to use is patient-oriented <lb/>and descriptive. There are studies and surveys using <lb/>various validated health-related quality-of-life and <lb/>patient-perspectives questionnaires. Most of them report <lb/></body>

We evaluated the burden of allergic rhinitis among <lb/>patients from the members of European allergy patient organizations. The Patient Voice <lb/>Allergy Survey was a quantitative, self-completion survey of 3562 patients with allergic <lb/>rhinitis (16 years and older). Background information on allergic rhinitis, severity of <lb/>allergic rhinitis symptoms and their impact on lives, nonmedical measures for relieving of <lb/>symptoms, types of medications, and concomitant conditions were evaluated. <lb/>Recent findings <lb/>Almost 50% of the responders reported symptoms lasting for more than a season. <lb/>Preventive household adjustments are expensive with little perceived benefit. Sleep and <lb/>emotional life are affected by allergic rhinitis. Most patients are satisfied with the current <lb/>allergic rhinitis medications; at least one-fifth report dissatisfaction. Patients perceive <lb/>that allergic rhinitis worsens other concomitant allergic diseases. <lb/>Summary <lb/>Future management guidelines for allergic rhinitis must take into account the results of <lb/>this survey. Such guidelines must promote relief from the emotional burden of allergic <lb/>rhinitis and from the negative impact on daily activities, encourage patient education, <lb/>and maintain and build on the strong partnership between patients and healthcare <lb/>professionals. <lb/>Keywords <lb/>allergic rhinitis, burden, comorbidities, costs <lb/>Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol 8:1-9 <lb/>ß 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins <lb/>1528-4050 <lb/>1528-4050 ß 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins <lb/>Copyright © Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.

			<body>Methods <lb/>The Patient Voice Allergy Survey was a quantitative, self-<lb/>completion survey, initiated, co-ordinated, supervised <lb/>and conducted by the European Federation of Allergy <lb/>and Airways Diseases Patients&apos; Associations (EFA) in <lb/>Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, <lb/>Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and <lb/>the UK. A total of 3562 questionnaires were collected <lb/>(Table 1). The following key areas were covered: (1) <lb/>background information on allergic rhinitis, (2) severity of <lb/>symptoms and their impact, (3) nonmedical measures, (4) <lb/>medication, and (5) concomitant conditions. A descrip-<lb/>tion of the questions appears in Table 2. The original <lb/>questionnaire was designed in English and was translated <lb/>in the local languages through professional interpreters. <lb/>The local patient organizations sent the questionnaire to <lb/>their members with a cover letter clarifying the purpose <lb/>of the survey and an explanation of how the results would <lb/>be used. The completed questionnaires were sent to a <lb/>central market-research agency (Aequus Research, <lb/>London, UK), which compiled a descriptive report. <lb/>The report was planned to be presented both as individ-<lb/>ual results by country and as consolidated pan-European <lb/>results. The latter only are presented in this paper. <lb/>Primary objectives <lb/>The aim of the this survey was to explore the impact of <lb/>allergic rhinitis on the lives of sufferers across Europe. The <lb/>primary objectives were to answer the following questions: <lb/>(1) what is the nature of allergic rhinitis and the signifi-<lb/>cance on daily life, (2) which aspects of life does allergic <lb/>rhinitis affect, (3) what is the prevalence of concomitant <lb/>allergic diseases, and (4) what are the costs for preventive <lb/>measures and medications and are they effective? <lb/>In the pan-European analysis results were weighted to <lb/>account for the returned questionnaires not being in the <lb/>2 Upper airway disease <lb/>Table 1 Number of surveys and proportion of responders among the allergic rhinitis sufferers per country <lb/>Country <lb/>Number of collected <lb/>surveys <lb/>Estimated AR <lb/>sufferers a (millions) <lb/>% of AR population <lb/>in PVAS <lb/>% of responses <lb/>in PVAS <lb/>Belgium <lb/>331 <lb/>1.7 <lb/>2.4 <lb/>9.2 b <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>272 <lb/>1.7 <lb/>2.4 <lb/>8.0 b <lb/>Finland <lb/>364 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>10.4 b <lb/>France <lb/>302 <lb/>17.0 <lb/>24.4 <lb/>8.1 c <lb/>Germany <lb/>186 <lb/>14.8 <lb/>21.3 <lb/>5.4 c <lb/>Greece <lb/>87 <lb/>1.7 <lb/>2.4 <lb/>2.4 <lb/>Italy <lb/>294 <lb/>8.0 <lb/>11.5 <lb/>8.4 c <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>199 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>3.6 <lb/>5.7 b <lb/>Spain <lb/>561 <lb/>5.4 <lb/>7.8 <lb/>16.1 b <lb/>Switzerland <lb/>222 <lb/>0.8 <lb/>1.2 <lb/>5.6 b <lb/>UK <lb/>744 <lb/>14.7 <lb/>21.1 <lb/>20.8 <lb/>Total <lb/>3562 <lb/>69.7 <lb/>100 <lb/>100 <lb/>a Taken from the Decision Resources Report 2001 (www.dresources.com/stellent/groups/public/documents/abstract/dr_008812.hcsp). <lb/>b Down-weighted countries (see text for explanation). <lb/>c Up-weighted countries (see text for explanation). <lb/>AR, allergic rhinitis; PVAS, Patient Voice Allergy Survey. <lb/>Table 2 A summary of the 26 survey questions <lb/>Background AR information <lb/>For how long have you had allergic rhinitis and who diagnosed <lb/>it first? <lb/>During which season, for how many days per week and during how <lb/>many consecutive weeks do you experience your AR symptoms? <lb/>What triggers your AR symptoms and how severe are they? <lb/>Impact of AR <lb/>How do your AR symptoms affect sleep, work, school, visiting <lb/>and/or meeting friends, travelling in public transport, indoor and <lb/>outdoor activities, choice of sport, choice of holiday destinations, <lb/>time of holidays? <lb/>How do your nasal and ocular symptoms affect you? <lb/>How does your AR affect you emotionally? <lb/>What are the three things that bother you most about your AR? <lb/>Did you take time off work/school because of your AR, over the <lb/>past year? <lb/>Have you ever been unable to concentrate at work/school, due <lb/>to your AR, over the past year? <lb/>Measures taken to ease AR symptoms <lb/>Have you had to make changes to your household, for <lb/>example purchasing special mattresses, pillows or duvets; <lb/>special household cleaning products; a humidifiers/air <lb/>cleaners; pollen screens; replaced existing furniture; removed <lb/>carpets?

			<body>in controlling runny nose. The results for sneezing and <lb/>blocked nose are, respectively, 58 and 56%. Itchy throat <lb/>and palate are perceived as more difficult to control with, <lb/>respectively, 10 and 12% of patients reporting their <lb/>current medications as not effective at all for these <lb/>symptoms. Only 4, 5 and 6% of patients report that <lb/>the current medications are not effective at all for, <lb/>respectively, runny nose, sneezing and blocked nose. <lb/>Allergic rhinitis and concomitant conditions <lb/>Asthma, eczema, food allergy and urticaria are concomitant <lb/>diseases for, respectively, 43, 32, 29 and 19% of allergic <lb/>rhinitis patients; in contrast, 37% of patients reported no <lb/>concomitant diseases. Generally, more patients among the <lb/>older respondents (over 65 years of age) report suffering <lb/>from concomitant diseases (especially asthma and food <lb/>allergy) as compared with other age groups. Seventy per-<lb/>cent of patients having asthma believe that their allergic <lb/>rhinitis worsens it. The proportion of patients perceiving <lb/>their allergic rhinitis as having a negative impact on their <lb/>concomitant diseases is not so elevated, though significant, <lb/>with 42, 40 and 37% of patients reporting allergic rhinitis to <lb/>negatively affect their food allergy, eczema and urticaria, <lb/>respectively. Almost all patients (94%) have discussed <lb/>their concomitant asthma with a doctor, whereas the <lb/>proportion for eczema, food allergy and urticaria is, respect-<lb/>ively, 76, 74 and 64%. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>To our knowledge, this is the first survey conducted in a <lb/>selected patient population with allergic rhinitis. These <lb/>are patients who are members of an allergy patient <lb/>organization. The survey addressed patient perceptions <lb/>of the impact that allergic rhinitis has on their lives and on <lb/>treatment practices. <lb/>Plants/flowers, house dust mites and animals were <lb/>reported as one of the most frequent causes of allergic <lb/>rhinitis symptoms. Tobacco smoke was the fourth big-<lb/>gest trigger. Although a recent study [12] could not <lb/>establish a significant relationship between exposure <lb/>to tobacco smoke and the increase in allergic sensitiz-<lb/>ation and allergic rhinitis in adults; in our study, every <lb/>third patient perceived tobacco smoke as a cause of <lb/>suffering, in addition to moulds, perfumes, feathers <lb/>and foods. <lb/>The prevalence of the seasonal allergic symptoms in our <lb/>patients is only 50%, whereas the other half suffers <lb/>during two or more seasons. This is in agreement with <lb/>another European survey reporting 49% of allergic <lb/>rhinitis patients having an established seasonal allergic <lb/>rhinitis [13]. Although no big differences were observed <lb/>between the triggers for the two types of rhinitis, there <lb/>was a trend of more triggers being identified by PER <lb/>patients. Although this could be an indication of a <lb/>higher multiseasonality for PER, many perennial trig-<lb/>gers were also perceived as being responsible for <lb/>IAR symptoms. <lb/>In terms of impact on sleep, PER was clearly the <lb/>more disturbing. Half of the patients suffering from <lb/>PER said they did not feel rested upon waking and that <lb/>their sleep was disturbed. This is important to note <lb/>since there is still a lack of sufficient of understanding <lb/>of how much tiredness and somnolence is caused by <lb/>the antiallergic treatment and how much it is due <lb/>to the disease itself. More differences between the <lb/>two types of rhinitis surfaced when patients had to <lb/>report their daily activities. The adverse impact of <lb/>PER on work, going out, visiting friends, and choosing <lb/>holiday destinations was more pronounced than the <lb/>impact of IAR. Almost half of the patients perceive <lb/>that their rhinitis makes them tired, worn out, irritable <lb/>and frustrated. <lb/>None of the 169 patients who removed their carpets <lb/>reported any beneficial impact on their rhinitis. More <lb/>than 70% of the 101 patients who bought special <lb/>bedding covers considered them as being not effective. <lb/>Replacement of furniture or the disposal of soft furnish-<lb/>ings, as well as buying humidifiers or air cleaners, was <lb/>equally ineffective or mildly effective. This is in confirm-<lb/>ation with other studies where despite significant <lb/>reductions of house-dust-mite load, no or little evidence <lb/>Allergic rhinitis Valovirta et al. 7 <lb/>Figure 9 Source of allergic rhinitis medications: on prescription (Rx), without prescription or both (percentage of patients) <lb/>22 <lb/>17 <lb/>25 <lb/>85 <lb/>19 <lb/>69 <lb/>58 <lb/>17 <lb/>10 <lb/>16 <lb/>15 <lb/>52 <lb/>4 <lb/>1 <lb/>Oral steroids (n = 321) <lb/>Eye drops (n = 855) <lb/>Nasal steroid sprays (n = 1453) <lb/>Antihistamines (n = 2260) <lb/>Buy without Rx; <lb/>buy with Rx; <lb/>both; <lb/>not stated. <lb/></body>

			<body>was observed, proving that these reductions can translate <lb/>into sustained improvements of clinical outcomes [14,15]. <lb/>All of the above findings question the appropriateness of <lb/>preventive household measures. Eventual household <lb/>changes should be part of the overall disease-manage-<lb/>ment plan discussed with healthcare professionals. These <lb/>findings thus highlight the need for a regular rapport <lb/>between patients and their treating physicians, for <lb/>improved patient education and for accessibility to <lb/>reliable information on effectiveness of household <lb/>measures. <lb/>The currently utilized medications for allergic rhinitis <lb/>are generally perceived as effective in relieving rhinitis <lb/>symptoms. The purpose of our survey was not to <lb/>distinguish between the efficacies of the various <lb/>pharmacological groups but rather to evaluate the over-<lb/>all satisfaction with the current treatment standards. <lb/>Whereas 20% of patients perceived their current treat-<lb/>ment as highly effective, a similar proportion of patients <lb/>were not satisfied with their treatment. A tendency of <lb/>better satisfaction was noted for drug efficacy on nasal <lb/>symptoms as compared with ocular symptoms. A reason <lb/>for this could be that nasal symptoms are generally <lb/>considered more bothersome and therefore their relief <lb/>leads to higher satisfaction. In addition, oral antihista-<lb/>mines and nasal corticosteroids, whose efficacy on nasal <lb/>symptoms is well documented, are the most frequently <lb/>used medications by our patients. Although the use of <lb/>the new nonsedating antihistamines and nasal steroids <lb/>has significantly improved management of allergic rhi-<lb/>nitis in the last decade, there is still some dissatisfaction <lb/>with the treatment results. This could be partially due <lb/>to noncompliance with the recommended treatment, <lb/>and to the nonprescribed, self-management of patients. <lb/>Another reason could be that patients do not always <lb/>have access to the most potent and efficacious of the <lb/>current treatments. <lb/>The relationship between rhinitis and asthma is complex <lb/>and has been the topic of interest of many scientific <lb/>publications [16 ]. Our survey, however, reveals that <lb/>this topic has come out of the academic world and is <lb/>understood and perceived as a real health problem for <lb/>most of the patients. Nearly all of the surveyed patients <lb/>with concomitant asthma have discussed it with their <lb/>doctors. Similarly, 75% of patients with other concomi-<lb/>tant diseases have talked to their physicians about them. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>Allergy patients in 11 European countries have voiced <lb/>their experiences of a disease which is not always seen as <lb/>serious enough to warrant attention from policy-makers, <lb/>prescription medications, doctor&apos;s visits, and follow-up or <lb/>patient education. Patients with allergic rhinitis revealed <lb/>the emotional burden and restrictions to daily life. They <lb/>shared satisfaction for the current treatment options, and <lb/>dissatisfaction for most of the preventive measures. <lb/>While being satisfied with medical treatment, patients <lb/>suffer a significant impact in daily life. The results of this <lb/>survey should be taken into account in future guidelines <lb/>on allergic rhinitis, and should promote relief of the <lb/>emotional burden of allergic rhinitis, stimulate patient <lb/>education, encourage relationship between allergic rhi-<lb/>nitis patients and healthcare professionals, and urge <lb/>governments to abolish preventable triggers in public <lb/>places, schools and work places. <lb/></body>
