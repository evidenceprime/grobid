			<p>A llergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory dis-<lb/>ease characterized by nasal itching, sneezing,<lb/> rhinorrhea, and nasal obstruction. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> A significant num-<lb/>ber of AR patients also experience severe eye symp-<lb/>toms, <ref type="biblio">1</ref> including eye itching, watering, and puffiness<lb/> (i.e., allergic conjunctivitis).

All rights reserved.<lb/> For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm<lb/> survey is the largest and most comprehensive national<lb/> survey to date. It was created to evaluate the burden of<lb/> AR and comorbid conditions and their effects on pro-<lb/>ductivity and quality of life. The other objective of the<lb/> survey was to compare patient and healthcare provider<lb/> perspectives on AR.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/> Allergies in America: A Survey of Nasal Allergy<lb/> Sufferers<lb/></head>

			<p>The Allergies in America survey was composed of two<lb/> distinct surveys, each of which consisted of telephone<lb/> interviews with national randomly selected samples.<lb/></p>

			<p>The National Survey of Nasal Allergy Sufferers. A na-<lb/>tional sample of adult patients with nasal allergies<lb/> was obtained by systematically screening 30,927<lb/> households using a random-digit-dialing telephone<lb/> survey. During the telephone screening, an adult<lb/> member of each household was asked to report the<lb/> total number of adults in the household and the total<lb/> number of these individuals Ն18 years of age who<lb/> had been diagnosed with nasal allergies. Patients<lb/> Ն18 years of age who had been diagnosed by a<lb/> physician as having AR, nasal allergies, or &quot;hay fe-<lb/>ver&quot; and had been either taking medication for AR<lb/> or had AR symptoms during the past year were<lb/> included in the survey. Telephone interviews were<lb/> conducted between January 5 and January 31, 2006,<lb/> and averaged 34.8 minutes in length.<lb/></p>

			<p>The National Survey of Healthcare Professionals. A par-<lb/>allel survey was conducted among 400 healthcare prac-<lb/>titioners, including a national sample of 300 physi-<lb/>cians. Telephone interviews were conducted with<lb/> national samples of three physician populations: adult<lb/> primary care, allergists, and otolaryngologists (100 in-<lb/>terviews were conducted in each of the three physician<lb/> strata). The adult primary care population was defined<lb/> as the medical specialties of general practice, family<lb/> practice, and internal medicine. The samples were<lb/> drawn as probability samples from the American Med-<lb/>ical Association and the American Osteopathic Associ-<lb/>ation Master List of physicians in the United States.<lb/> The samples were restricted to physicians in these<lb/> three specialty strata who were in active practice in<lb/> direct patient care in an outpatient setting.<lb/></p>

			<p>A fourth stratum of nurse practitioners and phy-<lb/>sician assistants completed the national survey of<lb/> healthcare professionals. The nurse practitioner sample<lb/> was drawn from state licensing board lists. The physi-<lb/>cian assistant sample was drawn from the membership<lb/> list of the American Academy of Physician Assistants.<lb/> A total of 50 interviews were completed in each stra-<lb/>tum and were conducted by telephone using the same<lb/> survey instrument as the physician survey. The inter-<lb/>views were conducted between January 17 and Febru-<lb/>ary 14, 2006, and averaged 19.4 minutes in length.<lb/></p>

			<p>The maximum expected sampling error for a simple<lb/> random sample of 2500 (e.g., the patient survey) was<lb/> Ϯ1.2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.<lb/> The maximum expected sampling error for a simple<lb/> random sample of 100 (e.g., primary care physicians)<lb/> was Ϯ9.8 percentage points at the 95% confidence<lb/> level.<lb/></p>

			<p>The response and nonresponse rates were deter-<lb/>mined also. Screening interviews for survey eligibility<lb/> were successfully completed in 30,927 households.<lb/> Among the 2821 households with eligible respondents,<lb/> detailed interviews were completed in 2500 (35% men<lb/> and 65% women) households, which resulted in a<lb/> response rate of 88.6%. Weights consisting of cross-<lb/>tabulations and frequencies were used in all analyses<lb/> to determine critical survey outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Development of Survey Questionnaire. Schulman,<lb/> Ronca and Bucuvalas, Inc., and experts in the field of<lb/> AR collaborated to develop this questionnaire, which<lb/> would collect accurate and relevant information on<lb/> AR. Survey questions were developed through analy-<lb/>sis of the relevant literature and identification of ques-<lb/>tions used to study similar diseases in accepted health<lb/> surveys. The AR patient questionnaire focused on gen-<lb/>eral health, AR triggers, AR symptoms, effects of aller-<lb/>gies on quality of life, and the effectiveness and side<lb/> effects of nasal allergy medications.<lb/></p>

			<p>Questions in the patient survey relevant to this pub-<lb/>lication are<lb/> 1. Would you describe your nasal allergies as sea-<lb/>sonal, or do they occur throughout the year?<lb/> 2. During what times of the year are your nasal aller-<lb/>gies the worst?<lb/> 3. During the worst 1-month period of the past year,<lb/> did you have [symptom] every day, most days a<lb/> week, a few days a week, a few days a month, less<lb/> than that, or never?<lb/> 4. Which of the following nasal allergy symptoms are<lb/> most bothersome to your patients?<lb/> 5. Which of these symptoms was the most bother-<lb/>some to you?<lb/> 6. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma?<lb/> 7. Have you had asthma in the past 12 months?<lb/> 8. During the last week have you had sinus prob-<lb/>lems, heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux dis-<lb/>ease, cold or flu, earaches, migraines, skin rashes,<lb/> fever, pink eye, or none of the above?<lb/> 9. Do your nasal allergies keep you from working full<lb/> time?<lb/> 10. On days when you had nasal allergy symptoms,<lb/> how much did the symptoms interfere with your<lb/></p>

Thinking about your productivity on a scale of<lb/> 0 -100, where 100 means 100% productivity, where<lb/> would you rank your productivity on days when<lb/> you do not have nasal allergy symptoms?<lb/> 13. Where would you rank your productivity on the<lb/> same scale of 0 -100 when your nasal allergies are<lb/> at their worst?<lb/></p>

			<p>The questions in the healthcare professional survey<lb/> relevant to this publication are<lb/> 1. Do you classify the severity of nasal allergies in<lb/> patients?<lb/> 2. What proportion of your patients with nasal aller-<lb/>gies would you classify as having seasonal rather<lb/> than perennial allergies?<lb/> 3. Which of these symptoms was the most bothersome<lb/> to your patients?<lb/> 4. For the average patient with AR, during allergy<lb/> season, would you say the condition impacted their<lb/> daily life a impacted their daily life a moderate<lb/> amount, impacted their daily life some, impacted<lb/> their daily life a little, or did not really impact their<lb/> daily life?<lb/> 5. Thinking about productivity at work on a scale from<lb/> 0 -100, where 100 means 100% productivity, where<lb/> would you rank the productivity of persons with<lb/> AR when their nasal allergies are at their worst?<lb/></p>

			<p>Weights were developed to correct for sampling bias.<lb/> The weights corrected for differences between eligible<lb/> patients screened and eligible patients actually inter-<lb/>viewed. An age and gender correction was used to<lb/> adjust results from the interviewed population so that<lb/> they would be similar to those that would be expected<lb/> from the screened population of allergy sufferers.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/> Burden of AR on Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>Yearly Pattern of Allergy Symptoms. Fourteen percent<lb/> of adults in the survey had a physician-confirmed di-<lb/>agnosis of AR and were symptomatic during the pre-<lb/>vious year of the study. This survey likely underre-<lb/>ports the overall population prevalence of the disease<lb/> because it does not include children or individuals<lb/> without a formal healthcare provider-confirmed diag-<lb/>nosis of AR. When asked whether their nasal allergies<lb/> were seasonal or persisted throughout the year, 43% of<lb/> nasal allergy sufferers reported that their allergies were<lb/> seasonal only, and 56% indicated that their allergies<lb/> occurred throughout the year (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Of those who<lb/> reported seasonal AR, 56% of patients indicated that<lb/> their allergies were worse during the spring season,<lb/> and 45% of patients reported that their allergies were<lb/> worse during the fall season. The majority (Ͼ58%) of<lb/> healthcare providers reported that they classified the<lb/> nasal allergies of their patients as seasonal or perennial.<lb/> Moreover, healthcare providers indicated that approx-<lb/>imately one-half of their patients suffered from sea-<lb/>sonal allergies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Symptoms of AR.</head>

			<p>Stuffy nose was reported as the<lb/> most common symptom (60%) experienced by patients<lb/> daily or on most days during the worst month for nasal<lb/> allergies (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Other most frequently experienced<lb/> symptoms reported by patients during the worst<lb/> month for nasal allergies included repeated sneezing<lb/> (46%), postnasal drip (46%), and runny nose (45%).<lb/></p>

			<p>Bothersome Symptoms and Severity. Nasal allergy suf-<lb/>ferers indicated stuffy nose (22%), headache (14%),<lb/> postnasal drip (14%), and itchy (10%) and watery (5%)<lb/> eyes as the most bothersome symptoms associated<lb/> with their nasal allergies (Fig. <ref type="figure">1, A and B</ref>). In contrast,<lb/> the majority of healthcare providers reported that the<lb/> symptoms that are most bothersome to their patients<lb/> included nasal congestion (94%), postnasal drip (75%),<lb/> and runny nose (69%).

Healthcare providers indicated that<lb/> Ͼ60% of their patients had severe or moderate symp-<lb/>toms. Furthermore, the vast majority (Ͼ94%) of<lb/> healthcare providers indicated that the symptoms were<lb/> extremely or moderately bothersome to their patients.<lb/></p>

			<p>Comorbid Conditions Associated with AR. When pa-<lb/>tients were asked whether they had been diagnosed<lb/> with asthma ever in the past or in the past 12 months,<lb/> 68% indicated that they had never been diagnosed<lb/> with asthma previously. However, 20% of the patients<lb/> reported having been diagnosed with asthma in the<lb/> past 12 months (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Sinus problems were re-<lb/>ported to be associated with nasal allergies in about<lb/> one-half of the patients. Other comorbid conditions,<lb/> with the exception of heartburn, were infrequently re-<lb/>ported.<lb/></p>

			<head>Burden of AR on Patient Productivity and Quality of Life.<lb/></head>

			<p>Approximately one-third of patients reported that their<lb/> nasal allergies caused them to miss work (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/> Thirty-five percent of patients indicated that their nasal<lb/> allergies moderately interfered with work. When al-<lb/>lergy symptoms were at their worst, the mean produc-<lb/>tivity was ϳ72%, indicating a decrease in productivity<lb/> of 23% during the allergy season from a mean produc-<lb/>tivity of 95% during the normal time of year.

Most healthcare providers (86%) be-<lb/>lieved that allergies affected the daily lives of their<lb/> patients. Moreover, healthcare providers indicated that<lb/> nasal allergies caused missed workdays in patients<lb/> with AR (Fig. <ref type="figure">2 A</ref>). Furthermore, all healthcare provid-<lb/>ers reported that nasal allergies affected patient pro-<lb/>ductivity at work (Fig. <ref type="figure">2 B</ref>), suggesting adverse eco-<lb/>nomic consequences as a result of AR.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that the preva-<lb/>lence of AR in the United States and around the world<lb/> is increasing. <ref type="biblio">4</ref> However, it is difficult to achieve an<lb/> accurate and reliable estimate of the prevalence of AR<lb/> because of the wide variations among the sur-<lb/>veys. <ref type="biblio">5,6,9,10</ref> The Allergies in America survey was de-<lb/>signed to overcome these variations by adopting opti-<lb/>mal data-collection methods and using a relatively<lb/> strict definition to estimate the burden of AR in the<lb/> United States.<lb/></p>

			<p>Allergies in America, one of the largest and most com-<lb/>prehensive national surveys conducted about AR, sug-<lb/>gests that, based on patient and healthcare provider<lb/> perspectives, nasal allergies persist in many patients<lb/> throughout the year. Moreover, nasal allergy sufferers<lb/> and healthcare providers relate that nasal congestion is<lb/> the most bothersome symptom associated with nasal<lb/> allergies. The survey also notes that the bothersome<lb/> symptoms of AR decrease patient productivity and<lb/> reduce quality of life. In a 2005 Roper Public Affairs<lb/> and Media Internet survey of 1000 adults with aller-<lb/>gies, the majority of participants indicated that they<lb/> experienced allergy symptoms in the morning, with<lb/> nasal congestion reported to be the most common<lb/> symptom compared with other symptoms. <ref type="biblio">11</ref> In an-<lb/>other large survey of 2355 individuals with AR, 85% of<lb/> individuals reported that they suffered from nasal con-<lb/>gestion, which affected their quality of life and produc-<lb/>tivity. <ref type="biblio">12</ref> In a large population-based cross-sectional sur-<lb/>vey of 15,000 households, the most commonly reported<lb/> symptoms included runny nose, sneezing, nasal con-<lb/>gestion, and tiredness. <ref type="biblio">13<lb/></ref> In this survey, patient and healthcare provider per-<lb/>spectives indicate that nasal allergy symptoms, includ-<lb/>ing ocular symptoms, are bothersome to patients. Fur-<lb/>thermore, physicians are aware of the degree of<lb/> discomfort, particularly the bothersome symptoms,<lb/> that their patients experience during a nasal allergy<lb/> exacerbation. However, there were significant differ-<lb/>ences in patient and healthcare provider perceptions<lb/> regarding the extent of the most bothersome symptoms<lb/> of nasal allergies. Notably, bothersome symptoms<lb/> are the primary reason that contributes to AR being<lb/> among the 10 major reasons for primary care physician<lb/> visits. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> In this survey, nasal allergy sufferers and<lb/> healthcare providers considered nasal congestion the<lb/> most bothersome symptom associated with nasal aller-<lb/>gies. Nasal congestion is also the most frequent symp-<lb/>tom of AR that significantly affects quality of life and<lb/> has been considered to contribute to sleep disturbances<lb/> in patients with AR. <ref type="biblio">15<lb/></ref> Nasal allergy symptoms are a major burden on pa-<lb/>tient quality of life and may negatively affect produc-<lb/>tivity. Therefore, quality-of-life instruments have been<lb/> developed to measure the effect of AR on patients. <ref type="biblio">16,17<lb/></ref> Generic and disease-specific questionnaires are the two<lb/> major types of quality-of-life instruments used in pop-<lb/>ulation surveys. Generic surveys are broad-based, re-<lb/>producible measurements that can assess quality of life<lb/> over all different disease states and conditions, treat-<lb/>ment interventions, and population states. The generic<lb/></p>

All rights reserved.<lb/> For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm<lb/> instrument used most often in AR studies is the Med-<lb/>ical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Sur-<lb/>vey (SF-36). <ref type="biblio">18</ref> In contrast, disease-specific instruments<lb/> are more responsive than generic instruments and al-<lb/>low the researcher to evaluate important aspects of<lb/> quality relevant solely to the condition studied. The<lb/> disease-specific instrument used most frequently in AR<lb/> is the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire<lb/> (RQLQ). <ref type="biblio">19</ref> Meltzer et al. have shown that patients with<lb/> AR had a poorer quality of life, established through<lb/> both generic (the SF-36) and specific (the Juniper Rhi-<lb/>noconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire) quality-<lb/>of-life instruments. <ref type="biblio">19</ref> Using the SF-36 generic quality-<lb/>of-life instrument, Bousquet et al. compared quality of<lb/> life in patients with moderate to severe perennial AR<lb/> with patients with asthma of variable severity <ref type="biblio">20,21</ref> and<lb/> reported that patients with AR had a poorer quality of<lb/> life than patients with asthma in numerous domain<lb/> measures such as social functioning, energy, mental<lb/> health, and limitations to both physical and emotional<lb/> problems.<lb/></p>

			<p>A major adverse effect of AR is poor nighttime sleep,<lb/> which may lead to daytime drowsiness, fatigue, and<lb/> indecision and may also lead to significant impairment<lb/> in learning and cognitive function. <ref type="biblio">22-24</ref> In this survey,<lb/> nasal allergy sufferers reported that their allergies in-<lb/>terfered with work and productivity, further indicating<lb/> that nasal allergy symptoms negatively affect patient<lb/> quality of life. Furthermore, all healthcare providers<lb/> recognized that AR has a negative effect on the pro-<lb/>ductivity of their patients who work. Indeed, the mean<lb/> decrease in total productivity (absenteeism and presen-<lb/>teeism) losses for AR have been reported at $593/<lb/> employee per year. <ref type="biblio">25</ref> In 2003, a study using 1996 data<lb/> estimated the direct costs of AR in the United States at<lb/> $3.4 billion/year. <ref type="biblio">26</ref> In another study, which evaluated<lb/> indirect costs to business as a result of AR, the total<lb/> work loss was estimated at 3.6 million days, with costs<lb/> to employers of $445.3 million. <ref type="biblio">27</ref> Moreover, AR results<lb/> in an estimated 2 million lost schooldays. <ref type="biblio">28</ref> A timely<lb/> management of AR with appropriate therapy may lead<lb/> to a better quality of life and may improve patient<lb/> productivity. Because AR is a chronic disease, treat-<lb/>ment options should be effective throughout the year,<lb/> without evidence of tachyphylaxis.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Allergies in America survey indicated that ap-<lb/>proximately one-third of patients with AR had been<lb/> previously diagnosed with concomitant asthma. AR<lb/> frequently precedes asthma and is a risk factor for the<lb/> development of asthma. <ref type="biblio">29 -31</ref> In support of these re-<lb/>sults, a recent report by the American Academy of<lb/> Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology estimated that 38%<lb/> of patients with AR have asthma, and other studies<lb/> estimate that 60 -78% of patients with asthma have<lb/> been diagnosed with coexisting AR. <ref type="biblio">29,32</ref> Notably, pa-<lb/>tients with asthma and concomitant AR have more<lb/> severe asthma than patients without AR. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> Therefore,<lb/> effective treatment options for the upper airways may<lb/> decrease the burden of asthma in patients with con-<lb/>comitant AR.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, the Allergies in America survey estab-<lb/>lishes that nasal allergy sufferers and healthcare pro-<lb/>vider perspectives are in concordance with regard to<lb/> the bothersome symptoms of AR. Effective treatment<lb/> options for the inflammatory process that results in AR<lb/> may decrease the burden of bothersome symptoms<lb/> and comorbidities of AR, thereby improving patient<lb/> productivity and quality of life.</p>
