	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Purpose Allergic rhinitis and asthma symptoms are detrimental to health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Health technol-<lb/>ogy appraisal agencies often require cost-utility analysis when assessing new interventions. Appropriate utility estimates,<lb/> which quantify the value of different conditions in cost-utility analyses, are scarce for allergic rhinitis and asthma health<lb/> states. This study aimed to generate utilities for allergic rhinitis and asthma health states from a European general population<lb/> sample of adults and children.<lb/> Methods Health state descriptions incorporating symptoms, impact of symptoms on daily life and symptom treatment were<lb/> developed using clinical guidelines. Descriptions were amended with clinician and patient input, and incorporated into a<lb/> survey in which each health state was followed by a standard gamble (adults) or visual analogue scale (children) item. The<lb/> survey was distributed to samples of adults and children aged 8 to 11 from four European countries that were stratified to<lb/> represent the general population within that country.<lb/> Results 1454 adults and 1082 children completed the survey. Mean health utilities ranged from 0.635 to 0.880 and those<lb/> elicited in children were lower (0.635 to 0.705) than those elicited in adults (0.812 to 0.880). Disutilities assessing the impact<lb/> of increased allergic rhinitis severity and comorbidities were also greater in children than in adults.<lb/> Conclusions Symptoms of allergic rhinitis and asthma were valued as having a clinically meaningful impact on HRQoL.<lb/> Children valued health states as poorer than adults, and further research should investigate whether this reflects true prefer-<lb/>ential differences or results from methodological and/or comprehension differences between the two groups.<lb/></div>
