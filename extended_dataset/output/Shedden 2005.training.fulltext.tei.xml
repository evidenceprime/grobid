			<p>This bias could have inflated the relative importance of nasal<lb/> congestion as a symptom of allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, given<lb/> that this was an internet survey, participation was restricted to<lb/> individuals with internet access. Whether this affects the general-<lb/>isability of the results is difficult to gauge, although it may be<lb/> hypothesized that those with access to the internet have a higher<lb/> socioeconomic status than those without, and therefore, better<lb/> healthcare access.
