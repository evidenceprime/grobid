	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Objectives: Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PCC) is a complex disorder<lb/> involving the hepatic hilum. Multiple endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-<lb/>atography sessions are necessary for diagnosis and treatment with underly-<lb/>ing cholangitis risk. Our aim is to clarify the initial-drainage-related prognostic<lb/> factors of PCC.<lb/> Methods: This study was a single-center retrospective study. A total of 104<lb/> consecutive patients diagnosed with PCC from January 2010 to February<lb/> 2020 were enrolled. We defined the diagnostic period as the time between the<lb/> first biliary drainage attempt and the final drainage when treatment, including<lb/> surgery or chemotherapy, was started. We focused on this initial period and<lb/> analyzed the endoscopy-related factors that affected mortality.<lb/> Results: Overall survival of all PCC patients was 599 days.Overall survival of<lb/> surgically treated patients and unresectable patients were 893 days and 512<lb/> days, respectively. In 48 surgically treated patients, drainage-related cholangi-<lb/>tis within the diagnostic period, defined as new cholangitis that occurred after<lb/> the first biliary drainage attempt, worsened overall survival from 1460 days to<lb/> 607 days. Endoscopic sphincterotomy, the first drainage method other than<lb/> endoscopic nasobiliary drainage, and four or more endoscopic retrograde<lb/> cholangiopancreatography sessions were risk factors for drainage-related<lb/> cholangitis. Drainage-related cholangitis increased pathological lymph node<lb/> metastasis. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage as final drainage was<lb/> the only prognostic factor in unresectable chemotherapy-treated patients.<lb/> Conclusions: Drainage-related cholangitis worsened the prognosis in PCC<lb/> patients who underwent surgery. Appropriate endoscopic retrograde cholan-<lb/>giopancreatography strategies, especially during the diagnostic period, are of<lb/> great importance in PCC.<lb/></div>
