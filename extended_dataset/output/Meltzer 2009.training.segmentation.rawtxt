Allergic rhinitis (AR), a chronic inflammatory disease of the 
upper airway, is one of the most common chronic diseases in the 
United States and is estimated to affect up to 60 million people. 
Pediatric Allergies in America is the largest and most 
comprehensive survey to date of pediatric patients and parents of 
patients with allergy, as well as health care providers (HCPs), 
regarding AR in children and its treatment. The goals of the 
survey were to determine the prevalence of AR in the US 
pediatric population and to collect information on what effect the 
condition has on patients in terms of symptom burden, quality of 
life, productivity, disease management, and pharmacologic 
treatment. This national survey screened 35,757 households to 
identify 500 children with HCP-diagnosed nasal allergies and 504 
children without nasal allergies who were between the ages of 4 
and 17 years. Parents of young children, as well as children 10 to 
17 years of age, were questioned about the condition and its 
treatment. In parallel, 501 HCPs were interviewed. This survey 

has captured previously unavailable data on the prevalence of 
nasal allergies and their most common and most bothersome 
symptoms, on the effect of nasal allergies on the quality of life of 
children, and on medication use, including both over-the-counter 
and prescription medications, and has identified factors affecting 
satisfaction with treatment. The Pediatric Allergies in America 
survey also identifies distinct areas for improvement in the 
management of AR in children. In fact, based on the results of this 
survey, it appears that HCPs overestimate patients' and parents' 
satisfaction with disease management and the benefit of 
medications used for the treatment of nasal allergies in children. 
Findings from this national survey have identified important 
challenges to the management of AR, suggesting that its burden 
on children in the United States has been significantly 
underestimated. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2009;124:S43-70.)

Disclosure of sponsor involvement: In any sponsored investigation the issue of bias is 
invariably of concern for the pharmaceutical company and the authors, as well as for 
the journal's reviewers and readers. During the conduct of this study, much effort was 
made to mitigate potential bias, and safeguards were put in place to limit the sponsor's 
participation. The Pediatric Allergies in America survey was designed by a panel of 
experts within the allergy and ear, nose, and throat specialties. The sponsor had 
negligible input during these meetings, except for stating that it had hoped the project 
would study the current magnitude of the prevalence and burden of nasal allergies. This 
limited sponsor involvement was not an attempt to shape or otherwise influence the 
direction or outcome of the survey. The survey questions, in concert with the expert 
panel, were written by and administered through Abt SRBI, a respected global strategy, 
public policy, and opinion polling organization that has as clients multiple Fortune 500 
companies; federal, state, and local governments; foundations; and universities. Data 
from the survey were not revealed to the sponsor before a follow-up meeting that was 
held with the clinician advisory committee, thus further minimizing any risk of sponsor 
bias of the data. Finally, the authorship includes only 1 person from the sponsoring 
company, Dr Wingertzahn, a PhD within their clinical development department. Dr 
Wingertzahn has a solid foundation in ethical research and has authored numerous 
manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals within the area of allergy. He was not a member 
of the core writing committee but was a reviewer of the supplement. We believe that 
pharmaceutical companies, no less than clinicians, are appropriately interested in 
learning as much as possible about the needs of their market and patients.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the 
upper airways that is characterized by the symptoms of nasal 
congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal itching. AR is esti-
mated to affect approximately 60 million people in the United 
States, and its prevalence is increasing. 1-3 The Agency for Health-
care Research and Quality estimates the prevalence of AR in 
adults to be between 10% and 30%, and several studies have es-
timated the prevalence of AR in children to be closer to 40%. 4-6 
Allergies in America, a recent survey of adults with nasal allergy 
in the United States, estimates that 1 (14%) in 7 adults is diag-
nosed by a health care practitioner with AR, nasal allergies, or 
''hay fever.'' 7,8 Most (80%) individuals develop symptoms of 
AR before 20 years of age, with 40% of patients becoming symp-
tomatic by age 6 years. 9 
AR can be categorized as seasonal or perennial depending on 
allergen sensitivity. Among US adults diagnosed with AR, 40% 
have perennial AR, and 20% have seasonal AR; an additional 
40% have perennial AR with seasonal flare-ups. 9 It is noteworthy 
that approximately 50% of adults with AR report that their symp-
toms last for more than 4 months of the year and that 20% report 
symptoms for more than 9 months. 2 
Although AR can be associated with significant morbidity, its 
effects are not limited to its physical symptoms. Often, the true 
effect of this disease involves the profound consequences it 
imposes on the patient's quality of life (QoL), emotional well-
being, productivity, and cognitive functioning. Many of these 
health-related QoL issues appear to stem, in part, from sleep 
disturbances associated with AR. 2 In addition to the physical and 
emotional toll that AR elicits in patients, it also places a consid-
erable economic burden on the US health care system. This bur-
den includes both direct costs to patients and insurance providers 
and indirect costs that include patient absenteeism (missed days at 
work/school) and presenteeism (decreased productivity at work/ 
school). 2 
Although treatment of AR often begins with environmental 
control to reduce allergen exposure, pharmacologic intervention 
is often required for control of moderate-to-severe symptoms. 
Intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) sprays are generally considered 
the gold-standard pharmacotherapy for AR in both adults and 
children. 10 Over-the-counter (OTC), as well as prescription, oral 
and intranasal antihistamines, oral and topical decongestants, and 
leukotriene receptor antagonists are also commonly used pharma-
cotherapies in both adult and pediatric patient populations. 1 Al-
though these medications can be effective at controlling the 
symptoms of nasal allergies, they can be associated with adverse 
effects, such as local epistaxis, nasal dryness, and irritation from 
intranasal medications and drowsiness from antihistamines. 1,11,12 
The systemic effects of INCSs are of particular concern in chil-
dren because of the absence of weight-based dosing, as well as re-
ports of cortisol suppression and growth slowing during treatment 
with INCSs. 13-16 In addition, currently available INCSs and other 
prescription nasal sprays might not provide complete or long-
term symptom relief in children. Limitations in the extent and 
duration of action of INCSs or other prescription nasal sprays 
might decrease patient satisfaction with treatment, thereby reduc-
ing adherence. 
Oral and intranasal antihistamines, although clinically effec-
tive for the treatment of both seasonal and perennial AR as a 
monotherapy, are generally considered to be less effective than 
INCSs for control of nasal allergy symptoms; as a result, 
antihistamines are frequently paired with either a decongestant 

or leukotriene receptor antagonist to improve their efficacy. 17,18 
In contrast, topical decongestants are very effective for improving 
nasal congestion but are inappropriate for daily use because of the 
potential for rebound of symptoms (rhinitis medicamentosa). 17 
Much of the data available in the adult literature regarding 
prevalence, burden, and QoL effects of AR have not been 
available with regard to children. Information regarding how 
side effects from treatment affect the daily lives of children and 
their adherence to medication is not known. Therefore the 
Pediatric Allergies in America national survey was conducted 
to gain insights into the prevalence of AR in children, its 
symptoms, its effect on QoL, its comorbidities, the use of OTC 
and prescription treatments, patient satisfaction with symptom 
relief from treatment, and the side effects from AR treatment and 
their role in the adherence and discontinuation of AR treatment in 
children. Because current practice guidelines for AR and AR with 
comorbid asthma recommend the use of INCSs as first-line agents 
over other approved therapies, this supplement places an 
emphasis on INCSs and nasal sprays in general when reporting 
patient satisfaction with symptom relief, side effects of treatment, 
and treatment adherence and discontinuation rates (Allergic 
Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma Guidelines; 2008 Practice 
Parameters). 

METHODS 
Survey design 

Pediatric Allergies in America, a comprehensive national telephone 
screening of 35,757 households in the United States, was conducted to 
identify subjects with nasal allergy between 4 and 17 years of age. This 
national survey was designed to use a credible data-collection approach to 
determine the prevalence of AR in the US pediatric population. This survey 
interviewed the parents of children 4 through 9 years of age and both the 
parents and children 10 years of age and older and collected information on 
what this condition means to those who have it in terms of morbidity and 
management of the disease. 
During the interviews, an adult member of each household was asked to 
report the number of children in the household between 4 and 17 years of age 
who had been diagnosed with AR, nasal allergies, or ''hay fever.'' The survey 
identified 500 children who were diagnosed with AR by a health care provider 
(HCP) and who had symptoms and had taken medication in the previous 12 
months. A comparison group of 504 children without nasal allergies was also 
identified (Table I). The calculation of overall prevalence of the disease in 
children was based on all children who were reported by parents to have 
been diagnosed with nasal allergies of all households surveyed that had chil-
dren younger than 18 years. All other calculations were based on children with 
(n 5 500) and without (n 5 504) nasal allergies, as specified above. 
The telephone survey lasted an average of 36 minutes (269 questions) in the 
AR parent group and 18 minutes (123 questions) in the allergy-free parent 
group. When parents consented, children 10 to 17 years of age responded to a

subset of up to 98 questions in addition to the parents' responses. Where 
relevant (ie, outcomes different), data from parents' responses are reported 
separately from those of the children's responses. The average interview 
length of 36 minutes at a rate of approximately 4 questions per minute meant 
that a respondent answered about 140 questions. However, many of the 
questions were contingent on a gatekeeper question (eg, ''Have you taken an 
OTC medication for your AR in the past 4 weeks?''), and subsequent questions 
would only be asked of those who answered in the affirmative. Hence 
respondents were only asked the subset of all possible questions that were 
appropriate to their condition and treatment. 
A parallel survey was conducted among 501 HCPs, including 100 
physicians in family practice, 101 allergists, 100 otolaryngologists, and 
100 pediatricians, as well as 50 nurse practitioners (NPs) and 50 physician 
assistants (PAs), to determine HCP's perspectives on children's nasal allergies 
and their treatment. Physician survey participants were drawn as probability 
samples from the American Medical Association and the American Osteo-
pathic Association Master List of physicians in the United States. The samples 
were restricted to physicians in 4 specialty strata who were in active practice 
and in direct patient care in an outpatient setting. The NP sample was drawn 
from state licensing board lists, and the PA sample was drawn from the 
membership list of the American Academy of Physician Assistants. HCP 
interviews were approximately 20 minutes in length and were composed of 76 
questions. Physician respondents were compensated $50, and NPs and 
physician assistants were compensated $25 for their time. Parents were not 
compensated; however, children aged 10 to 17 years who agreed to participate 
in a follow-up questionnaire were compensated $10. 
Schulman, Ronca and Bucuvalas, Inc, a national public opinion research 
organization and leading physician experts in the field of AR, collaborated to 
develop the Pediatric Allergies in America questionnaire. Survey questions 
were developed through analysis of the relevant literature and identification of 
questions used to study similar diseases in other accepted health surveys, 
including the adult Allergies in America survey conducted in January 2006. 7 
The AR patient questionnaire focused on general health, AR triggers, AR 
symptoms, the effects of allergies on QoL and productivity, AR comorbidities, 
and the effectiveness and side effects of nasal allergy medications in children. 

Statistics 

The surveys were conducted by Schulman, Ronca and Bucuvalas, Inc, 
between March and April 2007. Sampling was conducted by using list-
assisted random-digit dialing within a geographically stratified design for the 
US household population. List-assisted random-digit dialing samples are 
based on a sampling frame that includes all hundred-series telephone banks 

(eg, 123-456-78xx) with listed telephone numbers to which 2-digit random-
ized numbers are appended to complete a full telephone number. Although the 
restriction of the sampling frame to banks with listed numbers excludes an 
estimated 4% of US households with landlines, it permits an efficient way to 
generate a simple random sample of telephone numbers. 
For a simple random sampling of 500 respondents (ie, the sample of 
children with AR and the sample of children without AR), the maximum 
expected sampling error would be 6 4.4% at the 95% CI. For the comparisons 
between the samples of children with allergies and children without allergies, 
the maximum expected pooled error would be 6 6.2% (95% CI). For the 
survey of HCPs, in which the simple random sample consisted of 100 
respondents (eg, pediatricians), the maximum expected sampling error would 
be 6 9.8% (95% CI). This survey approach allowed for a relevant and 
statistically accurate reflection of parents' and physicians' perspectives on the 
management of AR in the 4-to 17-year-old population of US subjects with 
allergy. 
Where appropriate, the comparisons of responses by parents of children 
with nasal allergies and parents of children without nasal allergies were 
conducted by means of ANOVA (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC), and P values 
were reported. However, surveys such as the Pediatric Allergies in America 
telephone survey tend to obtain responses and opinions that cannot be formally 
verified. Much like the analysis of reported adverse events that occur in a clin-
ical trial, results from surveys are typically reported by using descriptive mea-
sures. Therefore except where noted, most survey results have been reported 
descriptively. 

Survey questions 

The questions in the patient survey relevant to this publication are detailed 
by chapter in Appendix 1. 

PREVALENCE OF PEDIATRIC ALLERGIC RHINITIS 

Although AR is currently estimated to affect approximately 60 
million people in the United States and prevalence is increasing, it 
is still considered by many to be a nuisance condition of 
childhood rather than a serious disease. 1-3 Many children become 
symptomatic and are given diagnoses of AR by age 6 years; 80% 
of all individuals with AR have symptoms before age 20 years. 9 
According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 
the self-reported prevalence of AR in adults is estimated to be be-
tween 10% and 30%, whereas in children numerous studies esti-
mate the prevalence of AR to be nearer to 40%. 4-6 Allergies in 
America, a recent survey of subjects with nasal allergy in the 
United States, estimates that 1 (14%) in 7 adults has a physician's 
diagnosis of AR, nasal allergies, or hay fever. 7 
Similar to the prevalence rate observed in Allergies in America 
for US adults, the Pediatric Allergies in America survey found 
that 13% of children had an HCP-confirmed diagnosis of AR and 
were symptomatic during the year before the survey. This value 
was based on parents' responses that of the 8,119 households 
surveyed with children 18 years of age or younger, 1,068 children 
had been diagnosed with nasal allergies. With the exception of 
this calculation of prevalence, subsequent analyses were con-
ducted based on 500 children with nasal allergies and 504 
children without nasal allergies, as noted in the Methods section. 
These estimates of symptomatic AR in children fall at the lower 
end of previous estimates of AR in the US pediatric population 
(10% to 40%). 4-6 Among households having children diagnosed 
with AR, 80% of parents reported that their children had used 
medication to control nasal allergy symptoms during the previous 
12 months. More than half (61%) of all children were diagnosed 
with AR by age 6 years (Fig 1, A), and the plurality of diagnoses

(43%) were made by the child's pediatrician (Fig 1, B). Interest-
ingly, the pediatricians surveyed estimated that among 95 patients 
(4-17 years of age) seen on average each week (Fig 1, C), 24% (n 
5 23) of patients had AR. These physician estimates of AR prev-
alence are similar to those reported by family practice physicians 
(29%), as well as by NPs and PAs (27%). Ear, nose, and throat 
specialists estimated that 44% of their patients 4 to 17 years of 
age had AR; allergists estimated that 67% of patients seen each 
week had AR (Fig 1, D). Although pediatricians see more pa-
tients, make more AR diagnoses, and provide the bulk of the gen-
eral management and treatment of pediatric AR, only 44% 
reported that they are familiar with professional guidelines for 
the diagnosis and management of nasal allergies (Fig 1, E). 
The survey found that, with the exception of allergists, few 
HCPs routinely use skin or blood tests to confirm a diagnosis of 
AR. In order of decreasing frequency of diagnostic test use, 
allergists (99%); ear, nose, and throat specialists (28%); NPs/PAs 
(12%); and pediatricians and family practitioners (7%) say they 
perform skin tests all or most of the time. Even fewer (17%) 
HCPs use blood tests to confirm an AR diagnosis. Despite the 
relatively low percentage of HCPs who reported that they 
routinely used diagnostic tests to confirm AR, 24% of parents 
said that their child with nasal allergies had a skin test, 11% said 
that their child had a blood test, and 13% said that their child had 
both to confirm a diagnosis of AR (Fig 2). 
Nasal allergies are commonly diagnosed as either seasonal or 
perennial, although many patients had both types of allergy 
triggers. When asked whether their nasal allergies were seasonal 
or persisted throughout the year, 313 (62%) parents reported that 
their children's allergies were seasonal only, whereas 183 (37%) 
indicated that their children's allergies occurred throughout the 
year (Fig 3, A). Similarly, most (54%) HCPs agreed that their pe-
diatric patients primarily had seasonal rather than perennial aller-
gies. Among parents of patients who reported seasonal AR, 76% 
said that their child's allergies were worse during the spring sea-
son, whereas 34% reported that their children's allergies were 
worse during the fall season (multiple answers were permitted; 
Fig 3, B). More parents report that their children's nasal allergy 
symptoms were worse outside (44%) rather than inside (3%), al-
though the remaining 52% of parents reported that the severity of 
their children's allergies was about the same inside and outside 
(Fig 3, C). 
Triggers of nasal symptoms can be divided into allergic and 
nonallergic types, and most patients reported multiple sensitiv-
ities. In keeping with the high percentage of seasonal allergies 

reported, the most common triggers of nasal symptoms in the 
allergic children were pollen (54%; including grass [25%], as 
well as tree and weed allergens), dust (29%), and animal dander 
(15%). In addition, nonallergic triggers, such as weather (19%), 
fumes and odors (7%), and exercise (6%), are commonly reported 
(Fig 3, D). 
The results of the Pediatric Allergies in America and Allergies 
in America questionnaires indicate that diagnosed nasal allergies 
are equally prevalent in children and adults in the United States; 
however, because they do not include adults or children without a 
formal HCP-confirmed diagnosis of AR, these surveys likely 
underreport the overall population prevalence of the disease. Most 
diagnoses in children are made by a pediatrician who is likely also 
the child's primary care physician. Most parents and physicians 
report that children appear to have seasonal allergies, although 
many also have perennial allergies. In contrast, the Allergies in 
America survey of US adults found that most adults had perennial 
allergies, with a slightly lower prevalence of seasonal allergies. 
When seasonal exacerbations occurred in children with AR, the 
majority of parents reported that their child's worst allergy 
symptoms occurred during the spring season, followed by fall. 
Adults also reported that spring, followed by fall, was the worst 
time of year for allergy symptoms. 

SYMPTOMS OF PEDIATRIC AR 

AR is characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, repeated 
sneezing, and nasal itching, common symptoms brought on by the 
body's immunologic inflammatory response to allergen expo-
sure. 19-22 Ocular symptoms, such as eye itching, tearing, redness, 
and lid puffiness, collectively referred to as allergic conjunctivitis, 
are also common symptoms of AR. 23 
Because the types of allergy symptoms experienced by chil-
dren often vary in frequency, parents were asked which of 12 
common allergy symptoms were experienced by their children 
during the worst 1-month period in the previous year. The single 
most frequently experienced nasal allergy symptom reported by 
parents was nasal congestion or a stuffy nose (52%), which was 
said to occur either every day (25%) or most days (27%) each 
week during their children's worst month for allergy symptoms. 
Repeated sneezing was also reported by nearly half (46%) of 
parents as occurring every day or most days during their child's 
worst allergy month. One third of parents reported runny nose 
(34%) and watering eyes (34%) as occurring every day or most 
days of their child's worst allergy month. In addition, more than

MELTZER ET AL S47 


1 in 4 parents stated that symptoms such as postnasal drip, red and 
itching eyes, and nasal itching affected their children on all or 
most days during the worst month in the previous year. Although 
less commonly reported as occurring every day or most days, dry 
cough, sleep disturbance, headache, facial pain, and ear pain were 
also reported as common symptoms during children's worst 
month for nasal allergy symptoms (Fig 4, A). 
Parents were also asked how bothersome specific symptoms of 
nasal allergies were for their children during nasal allergy flares. 
In addition to being the most frequently described symptom of 
nasal allergies, nasal congestion was also considered by parents to 
be a bothersome symptom experienced by their children. Three in 
4 parents reported nasal congestion as either extremely (32%) or 
moderately (43%) bothersome during their children's nasal 
allergy attacks. Postnasal drip (70%) and runny nose (65%) 
were also reported as extremely or moderately bothersome 
symptoms. Many parents reported headache, nasal itching, and 
ear pain, as well as red, itching eyes, to be extremely or 
moderately bothersome. Facial pain, dry cough, repeated sneez-
ing, and watering eyes were considered by at least half of all 
parents to be the least bothersome symptoms of nasal allergies 
(Fig 4, B). 
Parents (88%) who reported their children's symptoms as being 
either extremely or moderately bothersome were also asked 
which symptoms were most bothersome to their child. Most 
(27%) parents identified nasal congestion or stuffed-up nose as 
the most bothersome symptom, whereas headache (13%) and 
runny nose (12%) were the next most common replies. Dry cough, 
red, itching eyes, postnasal drip, and repeated sneezing were less 
commonly described as the most bothersome nasal allergy 
symptoms. Although frequently considered to be bothersome, 
symptoms of nasal allergies, such as watering eyes, nasal itching, 
ear pain, and facial pain, were only infrequently considered by 
parents to be the most bothersome symptom of their children's 
nasal allergies (Fig 4, C). 
In addition to parental responses, children 10 to 17 years of age 
were asked which nasal allergy symptoms they experienced every 
day or most days during their worst allergy month in the past year. 
Nasal congestion or stuffed-up nose (39%), repeated sneezing 
(36%), runny nose (35%), and watering eyes (20%) were 
frequently reported as occurring either every day or on most 
days of the worst month. A comparison of parents' and children's 
responses for symptoms occurring either every day or on most 
days of the worst month of allergy symptoms indicates that either 
parents overestimate the frequency of most nasal allergy 

symptoms in their children or that children underreport the 
frequency of their symptoms (Fig 5, A). 
Although there were some discrepancies between parents' and 
children's responses for the frequency of nasal allergies, parental 
reports of bothersome nasal allergy symptoms were generally in 
agreement with children's views regarding allergy symptoms 
considered extremely or moderately bothersome. During nasal 
allergy attacks, the most bothersome symptoms of nasal allergies 
reported by children were nasal congestion (26%), headache 
(17%), runny nose (12%), and repeated sneezing (11%; Fig 5, B). 
Additionally, nasal congestion, postnasal drip, headache, and 
runny nose were consistently rated as being either extremely or 
moderately bothersome by 60% of parents and children. 
HCPs were also asked to rank the nasal allergy symptoms that 
were among the most bothersome to their pediatric patients 
(multiple answers were permitted). Like parents and children, the 
majority of HCPs considered nasal congestion (91%) to be one of 
the most bothersome symptoms of nasal allergies. Additionally, 
runny nose (72%) and postnasal drip (67%) were reported as being 
among the symptoms that are most bothersome to their pediatric 
patients. Watery and red itchy eyes were also considered the most 
bothersome symptoms by approximately half of all practitioners 
(Fig 5, C). Regardless of symptom category, the vast majority 
(86%) of HCPs indicated that their patients' symptoms were mod-
erately or extremely bothersome; a further 67% of practitioners 
reported that their pediatric patients experienced symptoms that 
were moderate to severe in intensity during nasal allergy attacks. 
Nasal allergy symptoms have a profound effect on the lives of 
both children and adults. This survey identified nasal congestion, 
or stuffy nose, as both the most frequent and the most bothersome 
symptom of allergies in children, as reported by parents, patients, 
and physicians. Nasal congestion was considered moderately or 
extremely bothersome by more than 3 in 4 parents and 2 in 3 
children with nasal allergies. 
These results are similar to findings in the Allergies in America 
survey of US adults that helped establish that although children 
and adults had the same disease, they reported subtle differences 
in the frequency and severity of nasal allergy symptoms. AR 
symptoms are generally localized to the nose, nasal and oral 
pharynx, eyes, sinuses, and ears. Given the differences in 
anatomic structure (eg, Eustachian tube length and smaller lumen 
size of the nares) observed in young children compared with older 
children and adults, it is not surprising that the frequency and 
severity of symptoms should vary slightly between the 2 popu-
lations. For instance, more children than adults reported facial 
pain and ear pain as being moderately to extremely bothersome. 
Nasal congestion in the smaller airway lumens in children might 
result in the retention of fluids and increased pain in the ears and 
paranasal sinuses. In contrast, the increased drainage of mucus in 
adults compared with smaller children can manifest as postnasal 
drip: twice as many adults as children reported postnasal drip as 
one of the most bothersome of their nasal allergy symptoms. 
Indeed, bothersome symptoms of nasal allergies in children and 
adults contribute to the heavy burden of nasal allergies such that 
AR is ranked as one of the top 10 reasons for primary care 
physician visits in the United States. 23,24 

BURDEN OF PEDIATRIC AR 

Traditionally, AR has been regarded as more of a nuisance 
than a substantive disease. However, in 2006, Allergies in

America, a national survey of patients 18 years of age and older 
with nasal allergy, helped to describe the true burden of this 
disease on US adults. 7,8 In 2007, after this adult study, the Pedi-
atric Allergies in America survey was conducted to qualify and 
quantify the effect of AR on the lives of children in the United 
States. It appears that in children, as well as in adults, the burden 
of nasal allergy symptoms has a profoundly adverse effect on 

overall physical and emotional health, quality of sleep, and daily 
lives of children. 

Physical health 

In general, children with nasal allergies were significantly less 
likely to receive an excellent health rating by their parents than

were children without allergies. In fact, only 43% of children with 
nasal allergies were rated as having ''excellent'' health by their 
parents compared with 59% of children without allergies 
(P < .001; Fig 6, A). Parents of children with nasal allergy com-
pared with parents of children without allergies were more likely 
to describe physical, mental and emotional, and social problems 
in their children. 

Emotional health 

Parents of children with nasal allergy and allergy-free children 
were asked a series of descriptive questions regarding their 
children's typical emotional state over the previous 4 weeks to 
explore the association of allergy symptoms and children's 
emotional health. Children with allergies were found to experi-
ence significantly fewer positive feelings such that only one third

(32%) of parents believed that their children with allergies were 
''full of life'' all of the time versus approximately half of parents 
of children without allergies (P < .001). Similar disparities ex-
isted for other questions relating to their children's emotional 
health. Parents of children with nasal allergy and allergy-free chil-
dren, respectively, answered whether their children had lots of en-
ergy (37% vs 50%, P < .001), whether they were calm and 
peaceful all of the time (18% vs 29%, P < .01), or whether they 
had generally been happy all of the time (28% vs 32%, P < .05) 
in the previous 4 weeks (Fig 6, B). With regard to measures of 
physical and emotional health, the survey appears to indicate 
that children with nasal allergies, although heretofore generally 

considered physically and emotionally healthy and happy, consis-
tently were rated significantly lower on specific measures of hap-
piness and emotional health than children without this affliction. 

Social health 

The Pediatric Allergies in America survey was also designed to 
assess the influence of children's allergies on their social health. 
When parents were asked whether their children's allergies or general 
health interfered with normal childhood activities, a significant gap 
was found between the responses of parents of children with allergy 
and parents of allergy-free children. These responses suggest that the

effect of nasal allergies on children's social lives and productivity can 
be assessed in 3 ways: effect on absenteeism, effect on productivity 
(presenteeism), and effect on daily activities (avoidance). 
Nasal allergies, health, or both interfered with the daily school 
activities of US children such that approximately two thirds of 
children (with or without AR) had missed school or day care in the 
past 12 months because of allergies, health reasons, or both 
(absenteeism). Although the rate of absenteeism is roughly equal 
among children with and without AR, presenteeism (or dimin-
ished performance while at school) appears to be a significant 
burden of AR that is frequently overlooked: a large percentage of 
parents (40%) report that their children's condition interferes with 
their performance at school (P < .001). The true effect of presen-
teeism has not generally been considered in previous studies on 
the burden of AR in children. In addition to the survey's findings 
on absenteeism and presenteeism, 28% of parents reported that 
their children with nasal allergies avoided daily activities because 
of their symptoms (P < 0.001; Fig 6, C). Furthermore, when the 
Pediatric Allergies in America survey asked parents to quantify 
the effect of their children's nasal allergies, health, or both, par-
ents of children with allergies reported a 30% decrease in their 
children's productivity at school and at home when allergy symp-
toms were at their worst (Fig 6, D). 
Children with nasal allergies are also more limited in their daily 
activities than children without allergies. Almost twice as many 
(21%) parents of children with nasal allergy reported that their 
children's condition or health limited the kind of work or other 
activities they could do compared with parents of allergy-free 
children (11%, P < .001). In addition, when compared with the 
parents of allergy-free children, more than twice as many parents 
reported that their children with nasal allergies found performing 

work or other activities difficult (23% vs 10%, P < .001). It is sug-
gestive that the difficulty in completing assigned tasks that was 
observed by parents might explain the overall reduction (22%) 
in the amount of time spent by the child with nasal allergies on 
daily activities compared with the allergy-free child (10%, P < 
.001). Parents' reports of decreased productivity, difficulty in 
completing tasks, and reduced amount of time spent on daily ac-
tivities resulted in reductions in what the child with nasal allergies 
was perceived to accomplish on a daily basis. Parents of children 
with nasal allergies were more than twice as likely to report de-
creased productivity in their children as a result of their condition 
or health compared with parents of children without allergies 
(23% vs 10%, respectively; P < .001; Fig 6, E). 
Activity avoidance can be an insidious effect of nasal allergies on 
children's social lives. For instance, among children of school age, 
17% experienced a lot or some interference with school activities 
related to AR compared with 5% of children without allergies 
(P < 0.001; Fig 7, A). Similarly, when parents were asked whether 
allergy symptoms or health interfered with their children's daily 
activities, parents of children with AR were approximately 3 times 
more likely to report that allergies affect whether their child 
performs well in school (26% vs 9%, P < .001). General outdoor 
activities, going outside or playing with friends, and organized 
sports or exercise participation were limited approximately 3 to 4 
times more frequently in children with nasal allergy than in allergy-
free children (P < .001 for all). These reductions may contribute to 
the high prevalence of US children who are overweight (16%) or at 
risk for being overweight (32%), which is defined as the 95th 
percentile or greater or the 85th percentile or greater of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention sex-adjusted body mass 
index-for-age growth charts, respectively. 25 The smallest

difference in parental opinion between these 2 groups of children 
was whether indoor activities were limited: 12% of parents of chil-
dren with nasal allergy said that their children's allergies or health 
interfered a lot or some with indoor activities compared with only 
5% of parents of children without nasal allergies (P < .001). 

Sleep problems 

In addition to the general effects of nasal allergy symptoms on 
daily activities, the symptoms of AR have a profound effect on the 
ability to sleep for both adults and children with the disease. Several 
studies have demonstrated that nasal obstruction or congestion, 
such as occurs with AR, is associated with a disruption in the normal 
pattern of breathing in adults. 26,27 In fact, more than half (57%) of 
adult patients and 88% of pediatric patients with AR are estimated 
to experience difficulty sleeping. 28-30 One such study in adults, the 
Burden of Allergic Rhinitis, found that adults with AR have a 
reduced quality of sleep as measured by the sleep-problems index 
or the sleep-adequacy scale. Furthermore, this study found that 
adult patients with AR were approximately 10 times more likely 
to experience brief awakenings, or microarousals, during sleep 
when allergy symptoms were at their worst. 31 These disruptions 
were thought to be a result of increased upper airway resistance 
brought about by symptoms such as nasal congestion and runny 
nose. Sleep disruption contributes to daytime fatigue in many 
patients with AR; however, for reasons not completely understood, 
there appears to be an added effect of AR on daytime drowsiness 
that might be independent of nighttime sleep impairment. 32,33 

Furthermore, during childhood and adolescence, sleep-disordered 
breathing has been associated with an increased frequency of learn-
ing performance disorders, behavioral disorders, and attention-
deficit disorders. 34,35 AR has also been demonstrated to adversely 
affect childhood learning and decrease cognitive functioning. 36 
The data from the Pediatric Allergies in America survey 
support the assertion that nasal allergy symptoms commonly 
experienced by children disrupt both the pattern and quality of 
sleep. In fact, 40% of parents of children with nasal allergy report 
that their children's allergies/health interfere a lot or some with 
sleep compared with only 7% of parents of children without 
allergies (P < .001). Parents of children with nasal allergy were 
more than twice as likely to describe sleep problems, such as dif-
ficulty in falling asleep (32% vs 12%, P < .001), waking during 
the night (26% vs 8%, P < .001), and lack of a good night's sleep 
(29% vs 12%, P < .001), in their children compared with parents 
of children without allergies (Fig 7, B). These findings support the 
assertion that AR exerts a profound effect on the physical, mental 
and emotional, and social health of children in the United States. 

Comorbid conditions 

Comorbid conditions occurring with AR include eye symp-
toms, such as conjunctivitis, ear problems (otitis), and head-
aches. 17,29 For example, allergic conjunctivitis (red itchy eyes) 
was reported by parents to occur in 29% of children with AR ev-
ery day or most days during their worst month for nasal allergy 
symptoms. Other common upper airway issues in children with

AR include sinusitis, snoring, and dental issues, such as malocclu-
sion. 9,17,37,38 Previous studies have estimated the prevalence of 
otitis media in children with nasal allergies to be 21%, whereas 
35% to 50% of children with otitis with effusion were found to 
have nasal allergies. 39,40 Parents' responses in the Pediatric Aller-
gies in America survey support these data. Parents reported that 
children diagnosed with AR were approximately 5 times more 
likely to experience pressure-related ear pain at least a few days 
during their worst month for allergy symptoms than children 
without AR (P < .001). Among children with AR, more than 
half (56%) reported their ear pain as moderately or extremely 
bothersome. Interestingly, the peak season for both ragweed-
and mold-induced allergies coincides with the peak season for 
Eustachian tube problems in children with nasal allergies. 41 In 
fact, 16% of children with AR have had tubes placed in their 
ears compared with 9% of children without allergies (P < .05). 
Additionally, 18% of children with AR had their tonsils, adenoids, 
or both removed compared with 11% of children without allergies 
(P < .01). These findings demonstrate a nearly 2-fold increased 
incidence of surgery to treat ear and upper airway infections in 
children with AR versus children without AR, a finding that might 
suggest either an increased susceptibility to upper airway diseases 
in children with symptomatic AR or the frustration of patients, 
parents, and clinicians with the results of previous interventions 
(Table II). 
Several studies have clearly demonstrated that a strong corre-
lation exists between allergy and sinus problems in the general 
population, which are estimated to range from 25% to 80%. 17,38 
The Allergies in America surveys found that 50% of adults and 
43% of children diagnosed with AR had sinus problems, support-
ing the notion that nasal allergies might be a common factor con-
tributing to acute or chronic sinus problems. 8 Furthermore, 
parents reported that sinus problems occur more frequently in 
their children diagnosed with AR (43%) compared with children 
without AR (4%), a 10-fold increase (P < .001, Table II). Snoring 
is also a common association with nighttime symptoms of AR. 
Nasal congestion and obstruction as a result of AR might contrib-
ute to mouth breathing, with a resultant increase in snoring, which 
can then be considered an additional nighttime symptom of the 

disease. 9 In a study of adults who regularly (>15 nights per 
month) experienced nighttime nasal allergy symptoms, 47% 
were found to be chronic snorers. In comparison, the Pediatric 
Allergies in America survey found that more than twice as 
many children with nasal allergies snore every night (14%) or 
most nights (10%) compared with children without nasal allergies 
(5% and 4%, respectively; P < .001; Table II). 
In addition, frequent nighttime AR symptoms were also 
strongly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and 
chronic nonrestorative sleep in adults. 27 This is likely to be true 
in children as well, with 40% of parents noting that their chil-
dren's allergies interfered with sleep. Chronic mouth breathing 
in children, a common result of the frequent nasal congestion ob-
served in patients with AR, has also been associated with ortho-
dontic malocclusions. Children with nasal congestion are likely 
to breathe through their mouths, and mouth breathing has been 
linked to an almost 3-fold increase in incidence of orthodontic 
malocclusions compared with nose breathing. 37 
Parents report that significantly more children with AR com-
pared with children without AR had headaches (54% vs 19%, P < 
.001) and facial pain or pressure (28% vs 4%, P < .001), respec-
tively, at least a few days during their worst month in the previous 
year. Headache (59% vs 68%) and facial pain (53% vs 54%) were 
considered moderately or extremely bothersome by more than 
half of the parents of children with AR and older children with 
AR (10-17 years of age) surveyed, respectively. These figures rep-
resent a nearly 3-fold increase in headaches and a 7-fold increase 
in facial pain or pressure in children with nasal allergies compared 
with children without allergies. These findings suggest that chil-
dren with inadequately controlled symptomatic AR might experi-
ence an underappreciated degree of head and facial discomfort 
that is not shared in children free of nasal allergies (Table II). 
In patients with AR, concomitant lower airway involvement is 
common. There appears to be both neurologic and inflammatory 
crosstalk between these conditions. 42 Furthermore, AR is not only 
a risk factor for asthma, but asthma might also be exacerbated as a 
result of uncontrolled AR. There is increasing evidence support-
ing the concept that AR and asthma are similar chronic inflamma-
tory diseases affecting the upper and lower airways, 
respectively. 43 Recent surveys suggest a solid link between 
them: approximately 78% of patients with asthma have AR, and 
38% of patients with AR have concomitant asthma. 44,45 In 
many ways, AR and asthma have significant effects on patient 
QoL. 
The Pediatric Allergies in America survey found that among 
children diagnosed with AR, 39% also were diagnosed with 
asthma, and 28% of children diagnosed with AR also had asthma 
symptoms in the past 12 months. These figures represent a 
significant 3-to 4-fold higher incidence of asthma in children with 
AR than in children with no AR (P < .001 for each comparison). 
Interestingly, when compared with data uncovered in the Aller-
gies in America survey of adults with AR, the prevalence of

comorbid asthma in children observed in the Pediatric Allergies 
in America survey differed by sex. Forty-five percent of male chil-
dren and 33% of female children with AR had concomitant 
asthma, whereas 29% of adult male and 34% of adult female pa-
tients had concomitant asthma. These surveys show that although 
asthma is common in both pediatric and adult patients with symp-
tomatic AR, the diagnosis of asthma appears to be more common 
in pediatric male patients than in adult male patients. Numerous 
studies have shown that among children with AR, the ratio of 
concomitant asthma in boys to girls is roughly 2:1. 46-51 Although 
the Pediatric Allergies in America study describes a similar find-
ing that male children might be more prone to concomitant 
asthma than female children, the finding is closer to a 1.4-fold 
higher frequency in male than in female children. This discrep-
ancy between sexes appears to even out by adulthood, a finding 
that is supported by the Allergies in America surveys. 7,9 Overall, 
pediatric patients with AR have a 3-to 4-fold increased incidence 
of asthma versus children without AR. Treatment of AR symp-
toms in adults has been demonstrated in several studies to reduce 
the incidence and severity of asthma. 52-56 These findings suggest 
that the putative link between AR and asthma warrants further ex-
amination and that an expanded understanding of AR treatment 
effect on the incidence and symptoms of asthma in children is 
also warranted (Table III). 
The Pediatric Allergies in America survey has generated 
compelling evidence that children with nasal allergies might 
experience substantially more physical, mental, emotional, 
and social problems than children who do not have allergies. 
The increased burden of symptoms frequently undermines 
restful sleep, leaving children fatigued throughout the day. 
Daytime drowsiness as a result of AR can result in impair-
ments in learning and cognition through absenteeism, pre-
senteeism, and activity avoidance. In addition, the chronic 
inflammation associated with AR frequently causes comorbid 
conditions, such as allergic conjunctivitis; generalized facial, 
head, and ear pain, sometimes leading to surgery (eg, ade-
noidectomy, tonsillectomy, and placement of tympanostomy 
tubes); and other significant airway diseases, such as sinusitis 
and asthma. These findings are in concordance with those 
obtained in the Allergies in America survey of adults with 
nasal allergies. 

NEED FOR TREATMENT OF AR SYMPTOMS 

Through the combination of bothersome symptoms, compro-
mised sleep, and effect on physical, mental, and emotional health, 
AR has a profound effect on the daily lives of children with the 
disease. When asked to estimate the effect of nasal allergy 
symptoms on their children, 1 in 4 parents felt that nasal allergies 
affected their child's life a lot (9%) or a moderate amount (17%) 
during the allergy season. Interestingly, compared with parents, 
HCPs reported that AR has a far greater effect on their patients' 
lives: more than 3 in 4 HCPs estimated that nasal allergies affect 
the lives of their pediatric patients a lot (26%) or a moderate 
amount (51%; Fig 8, A). 
Many children cannot tolerate the discomfort associated with 
nasal allergy attacks without symptom relief. Parents reported that 
the amount of discomfort their children with nasal allergies 
experienced during nasal allergy attacks was significant. The 
majority (57%) of parents said that although their child's discom-
fort during an allergy attack could not be ignored, it was tolerable. 

Only 8% of parents believed that their children could ignore the 
discomfort caused by a nasal allergy attack. Similarly, more than 
60% of HCPs agreed that although their pediatric patients cannot 
ignore nasal allergy symptoms, they could tolerate them. One 
would expect that a child's ability to ignore nasal allergy 
symptoms plays a large role in their effect on that child's daily 
life. Both parents (33%) and HCPs (35%) agreed that the 
discomfort some children experienced during a nasal allergy 
attack was not tolerable without relief (Fig 8, B). 
In general, children with nasal allergies are more likely to be 
seen by a physician or allied HCP than children without nasal 
allergies. Most (83%) parents of children with nasal allergies 
reported 2 or more visits to their child's HCPs in the preceding 12 
months for general health concerns compared with 61% of parents 
of children without nasal allergies. HCP visits for nasal allergy 
symptoms were also frequent, with 62% of parents reporting that 
their children had seen an HCP about their nasal allergies in the 
preceding 12 months. Remarkably, 17% of parents of children 
with nasal allergies reported that their children had seen an HCP 5 
or more times in the past 12 months primarily for their nasal 
allergy symptoms. Although practitioner visits were frequent, in-
office immunotherapy for nasal allergies was uncommon: only 8% 
of patients received allergy injection treatments by their HCP 
during those office visits within the past year. 
Most children with nasal allergies take medication to control 
their symptoms. Three fourths (76%) of parents of children with 
nasal allergies said that their children took either an OTC or 
prescription medicine for their nasal allergies in the past 4 weeks. 
It is apparently not uncommon for OTC and prescription med-
ications to be used in combination for treatment of the bothersome 
symptoms of nasal allergies. In fact, a recent survey reported that 
many adults with AR use 2 to 4 medications simultaneously to 
control their AR symptoms. 57 When parents were asked what 
types of medication their children used for allergy symptom relief 
during the past 4 weeks, more than half (54%) reported the use of 
an OTC medicine, whereas slightly fewer (48%) reported use of 
prescription medications. One fourth (26%) of parents said that 
their children had used a prescription nasal spray, and one third 
(34%) of parents reported that their children had taken some other 
prescription medications (excluding nasal sprays) to control their 
allergy symptoms in the past 4 weeks. Only 24% of parents re-
ported that their children used no medication in the past 4 weeks. 
Historically, parents report that 34% of their children use pre-
scription allergy medications only, 25% use OTC medications 
only, and 39% use a combination of both prescription and OTC 
medications for nasal allergy relief. Only 2% report that they do 
not use any medication for AR (Fig 8, C). 
Parents and physicians recognize that nasal allergies have a 
moderate-to-severe effect on the lives of children. Although the 
discomfort associated with nasal allergies is generally considered 
by parents and practitioners to be tolerable for children, most 
parents and practitioners acknowledge that without symptom relief 
from medication, these symptoms cannot be ignored. Children with 
nasal allergies are more prone than children without nasal allergies 
to require visits to their HCP for relief of symptoms or for general 
health concerns. As a result of the discomfort and health effects 
caused by nasal allergies, most children take prescription or OTC 
medication to relieve bothersome symptoms of their nasal allergies. 
These findings on the need for treatment of nasal allergies in 
children are similar to data obtained in the Allergies in America 
survey of adults with nasal allergies. Forty percent of adults believed

that their nasal allergy symptoms had a moderate-to-large effect on 
their daily lives compared with 26% of children. 8 As a result, 69% of 
adults with nasal allergies reported that they were currently taking 
either a prescription or OTC medication to control their symptoms. 
Remarkably, when adult patients and practitioners were asked 
whether the discomfort caused by their nasal allergy symptoms 
could be tolerated or ignored, nearly half of adult patients (44%) 
and HCPs (49%) said that the discomfort could not be tolerated 
without relief, whereas 51% of adult patients and HCPs alike said 
that the discomfort could be tolerated but not ignored. These find-
ings are in contrast to the Pediatric Allergies in America survey, 
which reported much lower parent and practitioner estimates of 
whether children's nasal allergy symptoms were tolerable without 
relief. This discrepancy might suggest a reduced emphasis on how 
complaints of nasal allergy symptoms in children are regarded by 
parents and HCPs compared with nasal allergy symptoms in adults. 
Taken together, the data on the need for treatment obtained from the 
2 Allergies in America surveys strengthen the assertion that nasal al-
lergies have a profound effect on the lives of both adults and children 
with AR. Furthermore, it appears that medication is often required to 
alleviate these symptoms of nasal allergies and to reduce the burden 
of this disease on the daily lives of Americans with AR. 

EFFICACY OF CURRENT NASAL ALLERGY 
MEDICATIONS IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH AR 

Ideally, children experiencing uncontrolled rhinitis symptoms 
should be referred by their pediatrician to an allergy specialist for 
consultation and specific allergen testing. Once the determination 
that a specific allergen is responsible for the nasal symptoms, ocular 
symptoms, or both has been made, appropriate steps to remove the 
allergen or otherwise limit exposure to the allergen should be made. 
The benefit would be that identifying the causative allergen or 
allergens could dramatically improve the likelihood of encouraging 
reduction of the allergen burden in the home and of education to 
reduce allergen exposure outdoors. Methods to effectively decrease 
the indoor allergen threshold (albeit with mixed results) have been 
extensively described elsewhere. 58,59 Environmental controls, such 
as allergen avoidance, removal of indoor allergy triggers, or both, 
can be an important first step to the general management of AR 
and asthma, although, with the exceptions of avoidance of pet dan-
der and tobacco, they are not usually of major benefit. 17,18,20,60 
Avoidance can reduce overall allergen exposure and the severity 
of AR symptoms. Allergen avoidance can also be effective, to 
some degree, in controlling exposure to dust mites, mold, and fungi 
in the home (through humidity control, high-efficiency particulate 
air filtration, and cleaning with a dilute bleach solution for mold 
and fungi). 18 Limiting exposure to outdoor triggers on high-pol-
len-count days can be difficult for individuals who are sensitive to 
pollen, 17 although reporting of pollen counts as part of a daily 
news broadcast during the peak pollen season is becoming increas-
ingly common in many areas and might help sensitive individuals 
minimize their exposure. Although environmental control of 
allergen exposure is a necessary step in preventing AR symptoms, 
pharmacologic therapy is often required for control of moderate-
to-severe symptoms of nasal allergies. 60 
Numerous options exist for both OTC and prescription pharma-
cologic management of AR, including oral and intranasal antihis-
tamines, decongestants, leukotriene inhibitors, immunotherapy, and 
INCSs. Despite reasonably effective control of nasal allergy 
symptoms, these medications can have local side effects, such as 

epistaxis, nasal dryness, irritation, and burning from the intranasal 
medications, and systemic side effects, such as drowsiness from 
antihistamines. 11,12 Immunotherapy, an established adjunct to AR 
pharmacologic management, decreases nasal tissue reactivity 
through increased allergen tolerance or IgE attenuation by 
mAbs. 19,61 Although shown to be safe and effective for the treat-
ment of AR, immunotherapy is not generally considered a first-
line treatment and might suffer from poor patient adherence because 
of the prolonged treatment needed to obtain durable efficacy. 20 
INCSs are currently the pharmacologic standard of care for 
treatment of moderate-to-severe persistent AR. INCSs provide 
effective symptom relief by controlling the underlying allergic 
inflammation that results in the disease. Although INCSs are the 
gold standard for pharmacotherapy of AR, the extent that unwanted 
systemic effects, including bone mineral loss, growth retardation, 
adrenal suppression, and ocular disturbances, occur in children 
with long-term use is an appropriate concern. 14,62 Of particular 
note are reports of cortisol suppression and growth slowing during 
treatment with some INCSs. 13-15 Cortisol suppression might be 
problematic in children because of the absence of weight-based 
dosing of INCSs to effectively relieve symptoms. 13,15,16 
Currently available INCSs and other prescription nasal sprays 
appear to also vary in speed of relief and duration of action and 
might not provide complete or long-lasting relief of nasal allergy 
symptoms. 63 Failure of nasal allergy medications to effectively 
control all symptoms of nasal allergies in all patients might reduce 
satisfaction with treatment and decrease adherence to treatment. 
Sixty-three percent of children with nasal allergies who were 
participants in the Pediatric Allergies in America survey have 
used a prescription nasal spray (INCSs or antihistamines) to treat 
their AR, and 53% have used one in the past year. To better assess 
treatment satisfaction of current prescription nasal sprays in 
children with AR, parents were asked how their children's current 
medications performed in terms of completeness, speed, and 
duration of relief. Parents and patients alike were unhappy with 
the incomplete relief of AR symptoms obtained with their current 
medications. Most parents considered treatment to be ineffective 
if it did not provide rapid, long-lasting relief of all or most of their 
children's symptoms. Parents of children who had used a 
prescription nasal spray in the past 4 weeks were asked whether 
their children's current prescription relieved all, most, some, or 
none of their symptoms. Only 17% reported relief of all of their 
children's symptoms, but in addition, nearly half (47%) said that 
most of their children's symptoms were relieved by their current 
prescription. However, almost one third (29%) said that their 
children's current prescription nasal spray relieved only some 
symptoms, and 4% said that it did not relieve any of their 
children's symptoms (Fig 9, A). 
In addition to completeness of relief, factors such as speed and 
duration of relief obtained with nasal allergy medications play a 
large role in parent and patient satisfaction with medications. 
Generally, and surprisingly, INCSs are rated by both parents and 
children as having a very rapid onset of action. Indeed, half of 
parents reported that their children's current INCSs provided 
symptom relief in less than 1 hour (19%) or in 1 hour (31%). 
Notably, 23% of parents reported a 24-hour or longer delay in 
symptom relief with their children's current prescription. These 
findings suggest that current treatments for AR suffer from a great 
deal of variability in time to onset of symptom relief (Fig 9, B). 
Few parents believe that their children's current medication 
provides long-lasting relief of symptoms. Parents feel that

24-hour relief is a prerequisite for effective treatment. Among 
parents of children who used a prescription nasal spray in the 
previous 4 weeks, more than half (51%) reported that their 
children's current nasal spray lost effectiveness over the course of 
the day or night. Furthermore, only 36% of parents said that the 
medication relieved symptoms as effectively after 24 hours as 
when their children first took it. The perception among parents 
and patients that medication does not last 24 hours plays a large 
role in parent and patient dissatisfaction with treatment (Fig 9, C). 
Loss of effectiveness over time might be another character-
istic of nasal allergy medications because 29% of parents of 
children with AR reported that their children's medication had 
lost effectiveness, even when it was taken as prescribed. 
Thirteen percent of parents said that their children had expe-
rienced a loss of effectiveness over time with more than 1 nasal 
allergy medication, and another 15% said that their children 
had experienced a loss of effectiveness with only 1 medication 
(Fig 9, D). 

Parents of children with AR were also asked about their 
children's experience with common unfavorable attributes of 
prescription nasal sprays for allergies. Parents were asked how 
many of the prescription nasal sprays (all, most, some, few, or 
none) their children had taken for allergy symptoms had un-
wanted attributes. According to nearly half of parents, nasal spray 
dripping down their children's throats was the most commonly 
occurring side effect of nasal allergy medications. This side effect 
was said to occur with all (21%), most (8%), or some (13%) of 
their children's nasal allergy medication. The next most fre-
quently reported common attribute of current nasal allergy 
medication was bad taste. Nearly 2 of 5 parents reported that 
all, most, or some of the nasal allergy medications taken by their 
children had a bad taste. Fewer parents reported that their children 
experienced a drying feeling, burning, drowsiness, and headaches 
as unwanted attributes of their nasal allergy medication (Fig 10, A). 
In addition to being reported as occurring most frequently, 
dripping down the throat and bad taste were reported by parents as

tion of INCSs in children. C, Duration of INCSs symptom relief in children. D, Effectiveness of prescription

MELTZER ET AL S59 


being the most bothersome attributes of their children's prescription 
nasal spray. Nearly 3 of 10 parents of children with AR reported that 
nasal allergy medication dripping down the throat was moderately 
(19%) or extremely (10%) bothersome to their children. Slightly 
fewer reported that the bad taste of nasal allergy medication was 
moderately or extremely bothersome. A burning sensation, drying 
feeling, headaches, and drowsiness with medication use were 
considered less bothersome by parents (Fig 10, B). 
Notably, 59% of parents report that they have changed their 
children's nasal allergy medication at least once in the past few 
years. Parents reported changing medication more than once per 
year (8%), once per year (8%), or every few years (10%). Among 
parents whose children had changed nasal allergy medications, 
the most frequently cited reasons for changing medication were 
that the nasal allergy medicine was not effective enough (40%) or 
that their doctor had wanted to try a new medication (22%). 
Children wanting to try another medication or the feeling that the 
medication did not treat their children's allergy symptoms were 
reported by only 7% of parents as reason for discontinuation. 
Bothersome side effects, insufficient insurance coverage, and 
short-acting relief of symptoms were mentioned much less 
frequently as reasons for changing their children's nasal allergy 
medication (Fig 11, A). 
Parents and children were occasionally dissatisfied with their 
nasal allergy medication. Among parents and children who had 

asked their doctors for a change of medication, ineffectiveness 
(63%) and bothersome side effects (18%) were the most frequent 
reasons for dissatisfaction with a child's nasal allergy medication. 
Similarly, effectiveness wearing off over time (10%) and incom-
plete 24-hour symptom relief (9%) were reasons that the parent or 
child had been dissatisfied with nasal allergy medications. 
Difficulty in administration or problems with the dosing schedule, 
incomplete insurance coverage or high copay, or product safety 
concerns were mentioned less frequently by parents as reasons for 
dissatisfaction with medication (Fig 11, B). 
Dissatisfaction with nasal allergy medications can occasionally 
lead to poor adherence, as well as discontinuation of medication. 
Simply put, children often do not take their nasal allergy 
medication as prescribed. In addition to times when symptoms 
have abated, children also stop taking their medication as 
prescribed when it does not relieve their symptoms (26%) or 
when it loses effectiveness over time (24%). Troublesome side 
effects (20%) and worry about side effects (19%) were also 
reported by parents as reasons that their children stopped taking 
their allergy medication as prescribed. Nearly as many parents 
(17%) reported poor tolerance and a concern about long-term use 
as reasons. To a lesser extent, safety concerns and medication cost 
were reported as reasons why their children had failed to follow 
their physician's instructions regarding their nasal allergy med-
ications (Fig 11, C).

Although relatively few parents reported being dissatisfied 
with their children's current OTC or prescription nasal allergy 
medicines, 26% asked their children's doctors to change their 
medication because of dissatisfaction. The most common reason 
for parents asking their children's doctors to change prescriptions 
was that the medication was not effective enough at controlling 
their children's nasal allergy symptoms. Bothersome side effects, 
effectiveness wearing off over weeks to months, and ineffective 
24-hour relief of symptoms also resulted in the parent or child 
asking the doctor to change nasal allergy medication. 
In summary, most parents reported that they or their children 
were unhappy with the incomplete relief of symptoms provided 
by their current nasal allergy medication. These medications are 
not viewed by parents as providing rapid, long-lasting relief of all 
or most of their children's symptoms. Many parents and patients 
feel that 24-hour relief of symptoms is a prerequisite for an 
effective nasal allergy medication yet their children's current 
nasal allergy medication does not relieve symptoms for a full 24 
hours. Parents and patients also believe that the effectiveness of 
current nasal allergy medications can wear off over weeks to 
months. 
For comparison, the Allergies in America survey reported 
similar findings on the efficacy of prescription nasal sprays for 
the treatment of AR. Adults (61%) and parents of children 
(64%) with AR reported that INCSs relieved all or most of their 
nasal allergy symptoms. 8 Relief was also achieved in 1 hour or 

less by most adults (59%) and children (50%), although similar 
numbers of adults (17%) and children (23%) waited at least 
1 day to more than a week for the onset of symptom relief. 
Approximately one half of adults and children reported that their 
current nasal allergy medication did not provide 24-hour relief 
of nasal allergy symptoms. Interestingly, it appears that adults 
might experience loss of effectiveness of their nasal allergy 
medications over time more frequently than children. Adult 
patients (55%) and parents of children with nasal allergies 
(29%) reported a loss of effectiveness over time with 1 or 
more nasal allergy medications. 
Bothersome side effects were reported by both parents of 
children with AR (16%) and adult patients (21%) as reasons for 
dissatisfaction with INCSs and other prescription nasal sprays. 
Although adult and pediatric patients experienced similar both-
ersome side effects of nasal allergies, a drying feeling, drowsi-
ness, and headaches occurred more commonly and were 
considered much more bothersome to adults than to children. A 
drying feeling in response to the medication was considered 
moderately or extremely bothersome by 34% of adults and 14% 
of children. Drowsiness experienced with nasal allergy medica-
tion was reported as moderately or extremely bothersome by 33% 
of adults compared with 11% of children. Finally, 25% of adults 
compared with 13% of children experienced headaches that were 
considered to be moderately to extremely bothersome. Taken 
together, the Allergies in America surveys have identified similar

reasons for patient dissatisfaction with their nasal allergy med-
ication or disease management that might result in discontinua-
tion of treatment: incomplete relief, slow time to onset of relief, 
loss of effectiveness over time, and bothersome side effects 
contribute to this dissatisfaction in adult patients, parents of 
children, and children with AR. 

PEDIATRIC PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH 
PRESCRIPTION NASAL SPRAYS FOR AR 

Because AR is a chronic inflammatory condition, regular 
prophylactic use of medication might be required to achieve 
effective long-term control of nasal allergy symptoms. Adherence 
to the prescribed AR regimen is needed to maintain reduction of 
inflammation and resultant nasal allergy symptoms. However, as 
many as 1 in 3 adults might be inconsistent in the regular use of 
their prescribed AR medications, and 40% to 80% of these 
patients might discontinue treatment within 6 weeks. 64 
Results of the Pediatric Allergies in America survey strongly 
support assertions that patients' concerns over the efficacy, slow 
onset of action, and duration of symptom relief achieved with 
INCSs and other nasal allergy medications contribute to patients' 
dissatisfaction and nonadherence. In addition, the survey indi-
cates that the bothersome attributes of prescription nasal sprays, 
such as medication dripping down the throat, bad taste, and nasal 
drying, which are reported to occur frequently in most of the 
currently available prescription nasal sprays formulations, also 
contribute to patient dissatisfaction with prescription nasal sprays. 

Parent and HCP perspectives on patient satisfaction 
with current prescription nasal sprays 

Parents of children with AR and HCPs are in reasonable 
agreement in their perceptions of patients' satisfaction with 
disease management and treatment. When HCPs were asked to 
estimate the percentage of their patients who were ''very satis-
fied'' with the management of their AR, 3 of 4 providers reported 
that, on average, all (3%) or most (70%) of their patients 4 to 17 
years of age were very satisfied with disease management. Broken 
down by HCP category, allergists, pediatricians, otolaryngolo-
gists, family practice doctors, and NPs/PAs believed that all or 
most of their patients with AR were very satisfied with the 
management of their disease. Similarly, 68% of parents were very 
satisfied with the management of their children's AR (Fig 12, A). 

HCP perspectives on patient satisfaction with 
prescription nasal sprays 

In addition to satisfaction with disease management, HCPs 
were asked to estimate how satisfied their pediatric patients were 
with their prescription nasal sprays. Approximately 9 of 10 HCPs 
said that their patients were very or somewhat satisfied with their 
current prescription nasal sprays. In contrast to HCP assessments, 
however, only 3 (76%) of 4 parents said that they were very or 
somewhat satisfied with their children's prescription nasal sprays 
(Fig 12, B). When asked to weigh in on the cost benefit of pre-
scription nasal sprays for children, the vast majority (82%) of 
HCPs reported that the medication was worth the money. In con-
trast, only 63% of parents believed that they get their money's 
worth out of prescription medicines for their children's nasal al-
lergies (Fig 12, C). 

HCPs were asked which types of medication they preferred 
for their patients with AR (with multiple answers permitted). 
Forty-one percent of providers reported that their medication of 
choice was an INCS, 27% preferred prescription antihistamines, 
7% preferred OTC antihistamines, 6% preferred leukotriene 
receptor antagonists, 4% preferred a prescription antihistamine/ 
decongestant combination, and 4% preferred intranasal antihis-
tamines. The remaining 10% of HCP responses included pref-
erences for anticholinergic nasal sprays, OTC decongestants, and 
mast cell stabilizers. Among family practice and internal med-
icine HCPs, INCSs and prescription antihistamines were equally 
preferred (34% each). In contrast, providers who specialized in 
allergy, immunology, or otolaryngology preferred INCSs to 
prescription antihistamines by a considerable margin (47% vs 
26%, respectively). Similarly, pediatricians also preferred INCSs 
to prescription antihistamines by nearly 2 to 1 (40% vs 23%, 
respectively). 

Comparison of perspectives on AR 

Both parents of children with nasal allergies and parents of 
allergy-free children provided similar responses when asked 
about their attitudes concerning AR, its treatment, and its effect 
on their children's lifestyle. When asked whether nasal allergies 
usually cause some lifestyle limitations, nearly 7 of 10 parents 
from both groups believed they did. Both groups of parents also 
agreed that frequent nasal allergy symptoms can be prevented. 
When asked about the effect of AR on comorbid conditions, 
approximately three fourths of parents were aware that nasal 
allergies can make asthma worse and that nasal allergies can 
cause sinus infections. Although parents of children with allergy 
and allergy-free children alike agreed that nasal allergies can 
negatively affect children's lives, only 75% of parents of children 
without allergies believed that nasal allergies are a serious health 
problem in the United States compared with nearly 9 of 10 parents 
of children with allergies (P < .001). In addition, 35% of parents 
of children with nasal allergies and 25% of parents of allergy-free 
children believed that there are no truly effective treatments for 
nasal allergies (P < .001). Finally, parents with a child with aller-
gies were significantly less likely to agree with the statement that 
prescription nasal sprays are not safe for children (P < .05), a be-
lief that appears to be more widely held by parents of allergy-free 
children (Fig 12, D). This finding suggests that efforts have been 
made to make parents of children with allergies aware of the side 
effect profile of prescription nasal sprays. 

Patient and provider education 

Parents and HCPs agree that better education about nasal 
allergies is needed for both parents of children with nasal allergy 
and the children themselves. Nearly all parents and providers 
answered that there was at least a moderate to a strong need for 
improved education for parents of children with AR (Fig 12, E). 
Improved educational resources should provide an understanding 
of the burden of AR, its symptoms and available treatment op-
tions, and reasons for poor adherence and reduced efficacy of pre-
scription nasal sprays. Improved access to education should not 
be directed solely toward the patient and family, however. Despite 
an understanding of the AR burden, many HCPs appear to over-
estimate patient satisfaction with their prescription medications. 
This affects not only patient satisfaction with treatment but also 

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL 
SEPTEMBER 2009 

S62 MELTZER ET AL 


satisfaction with HCPs. Dissatisfaction with prescription nasal 
sprays in children appears to stem predominantly from failure 
of the medication to provide rapid, complete, sustained relief of 
nasal allergy symptoms, as well as from bothersome side effects 
of the medication's formulation. Greater HCP awareness of this 
issue might encourage education about the typical onset of action 
of prescription medications and the need for adherence to dose 
and schedule to maintain effectiveness, as well as the proper 
use of the delivery device to reduce side effects. 
Patient dissatisfaction decreases adherence to medication and 
results in lower-than-anticipated efficacy. In patients with asthma, 
nonadherence to the prescribed regimen has been suggested to 
occur for many reasons, including inconvenient dosing frequency, 
difficulty of use, and the side effect profile of the medication. 65 Be-
cause asthma and AR are both chronic diseases with a similar 
cause, improving the formulation characteristics of prescription na-
sal sprays (ie, dosing, ease of use, and sensory attributes) might in-
crease patient adherence to AR therapy and enhance patient 
response to treatment. This survey has identified a number of for-
mulation considerations for prescription nasal sprays for use in chil-
dren. The development of prescription nasal sprays with favorable 
formulation characteristics might improve efficacy and tolerability 
and reduce side effects common with prescription nasal spray treat-
ment. Improving the sensory attributes of these medications might 
also improve patient satisfaction and adherence to therapy. 

DISCUSSION 

The Pediatric Allergies in America survey has highlighted gaps 
in our understanding of AR and the profound effect AR has on 
children. During the times when allergy symptoms are at their 
worst, children experience nasal congestion, headache, postnasal 
drip, repeated sneezing, runny nose, and other symptoms on a 
near-daily basis. These symptoms were described as being 
moderately to extremely bothersome by most parents of children 
with nasal allergies. Because of the effect of these allergy 
symptoms on sleep quality, most children with AR tend to feel 
tired, miserable, and irritable at least sometimes during peak 
allergy exacerbations. 
In addition to examining the prevalence, symptoms, and 
burden of AR in the US pediatric population, the survey 
addressed the role of nasal allergy medications in the treatment 
of AR, including patient and provider perspectives on both the 
effectiveness and bothersome side effects of INCSs and other 
prescription nasal sprays. Parents and physicians generally agree 
that about one third of patients do not achieve relief of all or 
most of their nasal allergy symptoms from prescription nasal 
sprays. In addition to low perceptions of effectiveness, onset of 
relief was reported to be delayed for 24 hours or longer by more 
than 1 in 5 parents. Many children have also experienced 
decreased effectiveness of prescription sprays in treating their 
nasal allergy symptoms over weeks to months. Taken together, 
these perceptions on the overall lack of full effectiveness of 
INCSs and other prescription nasal sprays in many children 
might result in discontinuation of medication and reduced 
adherence to therapy. 
Parents reported that the most bothersome side effects of 
prescription nasal sprays were dripping down the throat, bad taste, 
and a burning sensation, which were moderately or extremely 
bothersome to many children. Often, these side effects were 
sufficiently bothersome to cause the child to stop taking the 

medication, request a new medication, or be nonadherent with 
their physician's instructions. The survey has also identified a 
number of reasons for the perceived lack of efficacy of current 
prescription nasal sprays and patient dissatisfaction with disease 
management. 
There appears to be a general consensus among both parents 
and practitioners that nasal allergy medications are lacking, 
whether for reasons of ineffective relief of symptoms, slow onset 
of effect, lack of 24-hour relief, or bothersome side effects. 
However, more than 85% of parents of children with nasal 
allergies report being generally satisfied with the nasal allergy 
medication used by their child in the past 4 weeks, whether it was 
an OTC medication, a prescription nasal spray, or another 
prescription medication. This suggests that parents might not 
have high expectations for relief of their children's nasal allergies 
and do not have a preference for type of medication. HCPs, 
however, overwhelmingly prefer INCSs (41%) and prescription 
antihistamines (27%) to OTC medications or other prescription 
medications (<16%) for the treatment of their pediatric patients 
with AR. 
Allergies in America, a survey of adults with AR, was also 
examined to identify differences in prevalence, treatment, and 
other aspects of AR in children compared with adults. The 
prevalence of AR was similar in adults (14%) and children (13%). 
Symptoms were similar for adults and children; however, the 
frequency and severity of some symptoms varied slightly between 
populations. The burden of compromised sleep on daytime 
activities was substantial in both populations. Additionally, both 
studies support the assertion that lack of efficacy and adverse 
effects of prescription nasal allergy medications affect patient 
satisfaction and adherence to treatment in both adult and pediatric 
populations. 7 
In addition to their effect on sleep quantity and quality, nasal 
allergy symptoms can have a profound effect on children's lives 
and activities. Children with AR were almost twice as likely to be 
limited in their activities compared with children without AR. 
Compromised health interfered with school performance in 4 of 
10 children with the condition compared with only 1 in 10 
children without AR. Furthermore, parents report a nearly 30% 
decrease in their children's productivity when allergy symptoms 
are at their worst. 
Few children can ignore allergy symptoms or tolerate their 
discomfort without relief, and nearly 3 in 4 have used medication 
for relief within the past 4 weeks. Although INCS sprays are 
considered gold-standard pharmacotherapy for moderate-to-se-
vere allergy symptoms, only 1 in 4 children with AR use an INCS. 
It also appears that despite INCSs being the pharmacologic 
standard of care for AR, nearly 25% of patients remain somewhat 
dissatisfied or dissatisfied with their children's INCSs compared 
with only 9% of HCPs. Dissatisfaction among parents and 
patients seems to stem from loss of efficacy over a 24-hour 
dosing period. Many parents also report reduced efficacy over 
weeks to months of INCS use. 
In addition to lack of efficacy, bothersome side effects of 
prescription nasal allergy sprays often lead to patient dissatisfac-
tion with medication. Bad taste and medication dripping down the 
throat were the most frequently reported reasons for both 
dissatisfaction with prescription nasal sprays and poor adherence 
to a prescribed dosing regimen. Development of prescription 
nasal sprays with formulation attributes that maximize efficacy 
and duration and minimize unfavorable attributes should result in

improved patient and parent satisfaction with their prescription 
nasal spray, improved HCP management of their condition, and 
improved adherence to therapy. 
The Pediatric Allergies in America survey data provide 
significant and important new information but have inherent 
limitations. This survey required that respondents state that their 
children had a physician's diagnosis of nasal allergy and ongoing 

symptoms or was receiving specific therapy for nasal allergy. The 
authors acknowledge that it would have been optimal for all 
children participating in the survey to have been referred for 
allergen testing to further confirm the AR diagnosis and to 
determine the sensitivity, specificity, or both of the survey 
questionnaire in diagnosing AR. However, this type of survey 
approach is used in the public health surveillance activities of the

National Center for Health Statistics and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, including the National Health Interview 
Survey, the National Immunization Survey, the Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance Surveys, and the National Health and Nutrit-
ion Examination Survey (NHANES). In addition, the Interna-
tional Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) 
study used a survey for the diagnosis of asthma and allergies 
without diagnostic follow-up. The NHANES and ISAAC data 
sets are used routinely in the medical literature to estimate the 
prevalence of both asthma and AR. Although documenting IgE 
sensitization would have contributed to the strength of the data by 
validating the survey's ability to appropriately diagnose nasal 
allergy in pediatric patients, the authors believe that the approach 
used in the Pediatric Allergies in America survey (as well as the 
ISAAC and NHANES surveys) is in line with current clinical 
practices for an accurate diagnosis of AR. Because parental report 
of nasal allergy symptoms is what physicians typically rely on in 
the clinical care of children, whether in an office visit or a 
telephone survey, the authors believe that the lack of an HCP-
validated diagnosis is not an insurmountable limitation of this 
survey. 
Furthermore, it is acknowledged that although the Pediatric 
Allergies in America survey was formulated and conducted in 
conjunction with the national public research organization SRBI, 
the questionnaire that was used in the survey was not formally 

validated. A validated test or scale is one that has been shown to 
measure what it purports to measure regardless of who responds, 
when they respond, and to whom they respond. The validation of 
multiple-item scales has been adopted in health research to 
measure multidimensional concepts, such as health (eg, Short 
Form 36) and QoL, where health and QoL are key outcome 
measures. By contrast, population surveys, such as Pediatric 
Allergies in America, do not have ''validated questionnaires'' and 
might or might not use ''validated scales'' within the question-
naire, depending on their focus. The 3 major health surveys 
conducted by the federal government, the National Health 
Interview Survey, the NHANES, and the Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance Survey, do not have validated questionnaires and 
include only a few validated scales. Most of the survey findings, as 
distinct from clinical trial findings reported in peer-reviewed 
journals, are not based on validated questionnaires or scales. 
Additionally, the primary tool used to measure efficacy in AR, the 
total nasal symptom score, has never been formally validated. 
Nonetheless, it is considered the gold standard in measuring the 
efficacy of agents that treat AR. In this regard another way to 
informally validate a questionnaire is through the repeated use of 
the same questions within the same study population (in this case 
patients with AR), an approach used by the Pediatric Allergies in 
America survey to test the reliability of responses and to identify 
ambiguity in questions. As an added precaution, the Pediatric

Allergies in America survey attempted to identify the extent of 
nonallergic rhinitis in our survey population by asking parents and 
children whether environmental triggers suggestive of vasomotor 
rhinitis (eg, fumes/odors, weather, and exercise) contributed to 
their nasal allergy symptoms. Weather was identified by 19%, 
fumes/odors by 7%, and exercise by 6% of respondents, suggest-
ing that nonallergic forms of the disease can contribute to the 
rhinitis symptoms observed in the survey respondents. However, 
at least 1 study has demonstrated that subjects diagnosed with AR 
might also be affected by nonallergic triggers 66 ; therefore re-
sponse to nonallergic triggers does not preclude response to aller-
gic triggers or a valid diagnosis of AR. In contrast, a positive IgE 
test result obtained by an allergist still might not rule out nonaller-
genic factors contributing to rhinitis symptoms. 67 The informal 
validation approaches used in this survey (eg, incorporation of du-
plicate questions and the attempt to quantify the effect of nonal-
lergic rhinitis in our patient population) give the authors 
confidence that the data obtained in this survey are valid with re-
spect to the stated goals. 
The HCPs who were treating the specific pediatric patients 
interviewed were not necessarily part of the survey. Not having 
the patient's personal physician respond to these questions was an 
inherent limitation of this survey. Although the physician respon-
dents were not specifically responding for the parent and child 
respondents (a limitation of any telephone survey), the percep-
tions of the participating HCPs about their own patients are valid 
and should represent their general perceptions. 
In addition, information gained in this survey on diagnosis and 
treatment is limited to the parent's or child's understanding of the 
information and the condition. About 95% of parent respondents 
and their children had health insurance. Approximately half 
of parents (both allergy and nonallergy) had a household income 
of more than $50,000 per year, 40% had a household income of 
$50,000 per year or less, and 10% were not sure or refused to 
answer the question. 
Another potential limitation of a telephone survey is that, given 
that 67% of the children were age 7 years or less at the time of 
diagnosis, AR could not be positively distinguished from recur-
rent upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). AR has been 
associated with frequent URIs, 17 and therefore even if the physi-
cian diagnosis was confirmed, one could not preclude that the fre-
quent URIs occurred because the patient's airway was inflamed as 
a result of AR. Indeed, it was a noteworthy finding that few phy-
sicians used diagnostic tests to confirm allergen sensitivity, and 
most patients were not seen by allergists. One factor that could 
limit the possibility for misdiagnosis, however, is that the most 
common time of the year for viral URIs in children is from Sep-
tember through February. This survey was performed in March 
and April, months that have lower infection rates and higher 
tree and grass pollination, and therefore the possibility that puta-
tive nasal allergy symptoms were in fact caused by an undiag-
nosed URI is greatly reduced. 
Both physicians and parents strongly agree that better educa-
tion about AR and its treatment is necessary. The results of this 
survey suggest that improvement in communication between 
HCPs and parents and patients is also needed. Finally, the survey 
results recommend the development of more effective, better-
tolerated treatment to improve adherence to prescribed therapy in 
order to reduce the burden of allergies in both adults and children 
in the United States.

Key messages 

d Pediatric Allergies in America is the largest and most 
comprehensive survey of HCPs, pediatric patients, and 
parents of children with allergy regarding AR and its 
treatment. 

d This survey has captured previously unavailable data on 
the prevalence and most common symptoms of nasal 
allergies, the effect of nasal allergies on children's QoL, 
medication use, and factors affecting satisfaction with 
treatment. 

d Findings from this national survey have identified impor-
tant challenges to the management of AR, suggesting that 
its burden on children in the United States has been sub-
stantially underestimated.

SURVEY QUESTIONS 

All questions were asked of adults. When noted in parentheses, 
questions were also asked of children 10 to 17 years of age. In 
addition, questions included in the HCP survey are noted, where 
applicable. 

Prevalence of pediatric AR 

Parents and children 
1. At what age was your child first diagnosed with nasal aller-
gies, rhinitis, or hay fever? 
2. What was the medical specialty of the doctor/HCP who 
diagnosed your child with nasal allergies? 
3. Was your child given a skin test to see to what he or she was 
allergic? 
4. Was your child given a blood test to see to what he or she 
was allergic?
