			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the past two decades, concern regarding<lb/> limited healthcare resources and rising expendi<lb/> tures for new treatments have increased the<lb/> application of health economic studies. These cost<lb/> effectiveness studies require valid and responsive<lb/> measures of health outcomes to evaluate &apos;effec<lb/> tiveness.&apos; Various methods have been developed to<lb/> compare medical interventions with respect to<lb/> their outcomes, including generic and disease<lb/> specific health status assessments and utility mea<lb/> sures.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are two approaches for health status or<lb/> health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) evaluation,<lb/> the psychometric-and utility-based measures.<lb/> Using a psychometric method, HRQL is assessed<lb/> with multiple domains such as physical, social, role<lb/> and emotional function and well-being. A utility<lb/> based (preference-based) technique aggregates all<lb/> health dimensions into a single index on a scale<lb/> measuring from 0 (dead or the worst health) to 1<lb/> (perfect health or the best health). Utility-based<lb/> assessments can be classified as direct and multi<lb/> attribute measures <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. The direct method requires<lb/> each individual to value either hypothetical health<lb/> states or subjectively defined current health states.<lb/></p>

			<p>Common techniques for utility elicitations are<lb/> standard gamble (SG) and time trade-off (TTO)<lb/> exercises. The SG method, based directly on the<lb/> axioms of utility theory <ref type="biblio">[2, 3]</ref>, requires the<lb/> respondent to choose between two alternatives: (1)<lb/> life with a specific condition, or (2) a gamble with<lb/> either perfect health (probability p) or immediate<lb/> death/worst health (probability 1 -p). The TTO<lb/> requests the respondent to consider what length of<lb/> life they are willing tradeoff to get perfect health.<lb/></p>

			<p>The multi-attribute method captures people&apos;s<lb/> health preferences in an indirect approach with the<lb/> use of a utility-weighted health classification sys<lb/> tem and scoring algorithm. This method facilitates<lb/> the collection of preference-based data in a con<lb/> venient way by asking subjects to complete a<lb/> questionnaire based on this health classification<lb/> system.<lb/></p>

			<p>As a chronic disease, allergic rhinitis affects no<lb/> less than 20 percent of the population <ref type="biblio">[4-7]</ref>, and<lb/> each year billions of dollars are spent on pharma<lb/> ceutical products for symptom control <ref type="biblio">[8, 9]</ref>. New<lb/> drugs are increasingly introduced into the health<lb/> care system, but little is known about patient pref<lb/> erences associated with the effects of these drugs. To<lb/> help clinicians to select cost-effective treatments, a<lb/> utility-based instrument is required for measuring<lb/> patient outcomes for economic evaluations. To<lb/> date, the Rhinitis Symptom Utility Index (RSUI)<lb/> developed by Revicki et al. <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>, is the only available<lb/> preference-weighted outcome measure for the<lb/> evaluation of rhinitis symptoms. Outcome scores<lb/> are generated using a multi-attribute utility func<lb/> tion (MAUF) and rhinitis status classification sys<lb/> tem based on patient preferences in the United<lb/> States.<lb/></p>

			<p>Few studies have examined similarities and dif<lb/> ferences in preference-based measures between<lb/> Western and Asian respondents, and it is uncertain<lb/> whether utilities are generalizable across cultures.<lb/></p>

			<p>Could the US-based multi-attribute preference<lb/> weighted function be applied to scoring rhinitis<lb/> symptoms in Chinese patients? This study aimed<lb/> to answer the question by comparing the RSUI<lb/> scores derived from the US-and Chinese-based<lb/> preference functions using data collected from<lb/> Chinese subjects.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/> Rhinitis Symptom Utility Index (RSUI)<lb/></head>

			<p>The RSUI is a preference-weighted measure of<lb/> common rhinitis symptoms <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. In the question<lb/> naire (Appendix), five rhinitis-related symptoms<lb/> (stuffy or blocked nose, runny nose, sneezing,<lb/> itchy-watery eyes, and itchy nose or throat) are<lb/> assessed with four-point Likert scales in regard to<lb/> their frequency and severity during a 14-day peri<lb/> od. The frequency of each symptom is judged as<lb/> either &apos;not at all,&apos; &apos;1-3 days,&apos; &apos;4-7 days,&apos; or &apos;8<lb/> 14 days.&apos; The severity of each symptom is evalu<lb/> ated as &apos;not applicable,&apos; &apos;mild,&apos; &apos;moderate&apos; or<lb/> &apos;severe.&apos; The levels within each symptom (attri<lb/> bute) as listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> vary from no symptoms<lb/> to severe symptoms for 8-14 days. The RSUI is a<lb/> single index of the overall rhinitis state on a scale<lb/> where the best state (no symptoms) has a score of 1<lb/> and the worst rhinitis state (severe symptoms for<lb/> 8-14 days) has a score of 0.<lb/></p>

			<p>The RSUI questionnaire was translated into<lb/> Chinese using an iterative forward-backward<lb/> translation process, as defined by the International<lb/> Quality of Life Assessment Project Group <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The method for translation followed an iterative<lb/> process of forward translation by independent<lb/> translators, review and testing, back translation by<lb/> independent translators, and review and testing<lb/> until a linguistic and culturally acceptable trans<lb/> lated version was developed. The final Chinese<lb/> translation of the RSUI was pilot tested with 20<lb/> subjects using qualitative methods to examine the<lb/></p>

The pilot<lb/> study confirmed the quality of the translation and<lb/> cultural adaptation of the RSUI into Chinese.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Patient sample<lb/></head>

			<p>Study subjects were a convenience sample of pa<lb/> tients who attended the ENT clinic at a university<lb/> affiliated hospital in Hong Kong. Ten patients<lb/> participated in a pilot test of visual props (i.e.,<lb/> colored chance cards and probability wheels) for<lb/> assessing utilities, and another 10 patients partic<lb/> ipated in a pilot test of computer-interactive<lb/> interviews. Based on the pilot results, we deter<lb/> mined that the computer-administered approach<lb/> was acceptable and worked best given that the<lb/> respondents demonstrated better comprehension<lb/> and concentration in the computer administration.<lb/></p>

			<p>One hundred and sixteen Chinese patients who<lb/> were aged 18 or older and had a history of allergic<lb/> rhinitis were recruited for the field test. Subjects<lb/> with sinusitis, cognitive disorder, cold or influenza<lb/> in the past 14 days, or a nasal surgery in the past<lb/> 6 weeks were excluded from the study. In this<lb/> study, 84% of eligible patients contacted agreed to<lb/> participate. The most frequent reason for non<lb/> participation was the study time commitment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Clinical and health-related measures<lb/></head>

			<p>Disease severity<lb/> Prior to the questionnaire administration and<lb/> preference interviews, subjects were seen by two<lb/> otorhinolaryngologists for disease-severity ratings.<lb/></p>

			<p>Lebel et al.&apos;s Rhinitis Symptom Score (RSS) <ref type="biblio">[12]<lb/></ref> was used to confirm the diagnosis and determine<lb/> disease severity. RSS scores were rated from 0 to<lb/> 12 where higher scores indicated more severe<lb/> rhinitis symptoms. Based on the RSS rating and<lb/> clinical judgment, each physician independently<lb/> determined the patient&apos;s severity of rhinitis on a<lb/> six-point Likert scale from 1 (very mild rhinitis) to<lb/> 6 (most severe rhinitis). The mean of the two<lb/> physician-ratings were used to define disease<lb/> severity where scores &lt;3 were defined as mild,<lb/> scores 3-4 as moderate, scores &gt; 4 as severe.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, the respondent was asked to rate<lb/> his/her current rhinitis status from 0 (the worst<lb/> possible rhinitis state) to 100 (perfect health). VAS<lb/> 67-99 was considered as mild, 34-66 as moderate,<lb/> and 0-33 as severe symptoms. Patients also<lb/> reported whether or not they required medications<lb/> to control their symptoms in the past two weeks.<lb/></p>

			<head>Generic health status measure<lb/></head>

			<p>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form<lb/> Health Survey (SF-36) Chinese Hong Kong ver<lb/> sion <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref> was used to examine convergent validity<lb/> of the RSUI. In the SF-36 <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>, one item measures<lb/> health transition. The remaining 35 items are<lb/> grouped into eight domains: physical functioning,<lb/> role limitation due to physical problems, bodily<lb/> pain, general health, vitality, social functioning,<lb/> role limitation due to emotional problems, and<lb/> mental health. Each domain score ranges from 0 to<lb/> 100, where higher scale scores reflect better func<lb/> tioning and well-being. The SF-36 has extensive<lb/> evidence supporting reliability and validity, and<lb/> has been used in multiple community-based clini<lb/> cal studies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Preference-based measures<lb/> The preference-weighting scheme used to generate<lb/> the Chinese RSUI was based on the methods in the<lb/> original US RSUI study <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. Five single symp<lb/> toms, each with 10 levels (see Appendix), were<lb/> rated on the 0-100 point VAS. Five corner<lb/> symptom states and five hypothetical multiple<lb/> symptom states (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) were assessed using both<lb/> VAS rating scales and the standard gamble (SG).<lb/></p>

			<p>A corner symptom state was defined as one<lb/> symptom at the worst possible level of severity<lb/> (i.e., most severe) and frequency (i.e., 8-14 days)<lb/> while the remaining four symptoms were absent.<lb/></p>

			<p>Multiple symptom states were combinations of<lb/> different rhinitis symptoms with various levels of<lb/> severity and frequency.<lb/></p>

			<p>For the VAS ratings, a vertical Feeling Ther<lb/> mometer (FT) marked with numerical scales from<lb/> 0 to 100 units was presented to the patient in the<lb/> form of computer image. The FT was anchored at<lb/> one end by the worst rhinitis state (0) and at one<lb/> end by the best rhinitis state (100). For the within<lb/> attribute (symptom) VAS ratings, the &apos;worst rhi<lb/> nitis state&apos; was the most severe and frequent rele<lb/> vant symptom (i.e., runny nose on 8-14 days) and<lb/> the best rhinitis state was no symptom (i.e., no<lb/> runny nose). For the VAS ratings for the corner<lb/> and multisymptom-states, the worst rhinitis state<lb/> was defined as the all-worst state (i.e., all five<lb/> symptoms most severe on 8-14 days) and the best<lb/> rhinitis state was a state where none of the symp<lb/> toms were present. During the VAS assessment,<lb/> various hypothetical rhinitis states were displayed<lb/> adjacent to the FT, and the respondent indicated<lb/> the valuation of each hypothetical rhinitis state by<lb/> moving the level mark of the thermometer. Ties<lb/> were allowed and the relative spacing between<lb/> pairs of states had to reflect the subject&apos;s judgment<lb/> about the relative differences in preferences. The<lb/> respondent could view previous ratings on the<lb/> screen. Following the ranking of the single symp<lb/> tom states, corner states (one severe symptom<lb/> each), and multiple symptom states, the respon<lb/> dent rated his/her own health in current rhinitis<lb/> status. Time was allowed for the respondent to<lb/> re-adjust the ratings at the end of each session.<lb/></p>

			<p>Changes were allowed even up to the end of the<lb/> FT measures. The numerical value of the FT<lb/> adjacent to the placement of each rhinitis state was<lb/> immediately saved in an electronic record during<lb/> the process. To enhance the patient&apos;s understand<lb/> ing of the rating tasks, a warm up exercise was<lb/> performed with the use of paper FT and rhinitis<lb/> state arrow-cards before the computer adminis<lb/> tration.<lb/></p>

			<p>For the SG exercises, two colored circles (Op<lb/> tion A and Option B) were displayed on a com<lb/> puter screen. Option A was a certain hypothetical<lb/> rhinitis state (e.g., a corner state) whereas Option<lb/></p>

			<p>B was a gamble of an uncertain rhinitis outcome<lb/> which varied the probabilities of either the best {p)<lb/> or the worst rhinitis state {l-p). The best rhinitis<lb/> state was described as none of the symptoms<lb/> present and the worst rhinitis state was the all<lb/> worst state (see above). During the computer<lb/> interactive interviews, the participant was asked to<lb/> state his/her preference choice between Option A<lb/> and Option B. The gamble in Option B started<lb/> with 100% chance of the best state (no symptoms)<lb/> and 0% chance of the worst rhinitis state for the<lb/> following two weeks. If the respondent selected<lb/> Option B, a click on the B button would make the<lb/> gamble change to 50% chance of the best state and<lb/> 50% chance of the worst state. Again, the<lb/> respondent was asked to state his/her preference<lb/> between Option A and Option B. The process went<lb/> on and the probabilities of the best {p) and the<lb/> worse state {l-p) were varied in an iterative<lb/> interval-division manner <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> until the respondent<lb/> was indifferent to the choices between Option A<lb/> and Option B. This exercise was repeated for each<lb/> of the corner states and multi-symptom states.<lb/></p>

			<p>Patient preferences under uncertainty for the<lb/> health states were represented on a scale from 0 to<lb/> 1, where 0 stands for the worst rhinitis state and 1<lb/> stands for the best rhinitis state. A warm-up<lb/> exercise with the aid of a probability wheel was<lb/> carried out before the actual computer-based<lb/> interview. The pre-test exercise aimed to introduce<lb/> or reinforce the concept of probability and most<lb/> important to ensure subject comprehension on the<lb/> meaning of &apos;indifference&apos; between the two alter<lb/> natives in the SG task.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data collection procedures<lb/></head>

			<p>After obtaining consent, the participant was seen<lb/> separately by two otorhinolaryngologists for the<lb/> diagnosis and disease-severity rating. On comple<lb/> tion of the RSUI and SF-36, the subject was<lb/> interviewed for preference measures by a single<lb/> well-trained interviewer. For the evaluation of<lb/> RSUI test-retest reliability, subjects completed the<lb/> RSUI two weeks after the baseline administration.<lb/></p>

			<p>They also responded to a question on the change<lb/> in rhintis status on a five-point global scale where<lb/> 1 = better, 2 = slightly better, 3 = more or less the<lb/> same, 4 = slightly worse, and 5 = worse.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>The 100-point VAS values were transformed to a<lb/> scale of 0 to 1, where 0 indicated the worst<lb/> symptom(s) and 1 represented no symptom(s). To<lb/> facilitate comparisons with the US-based RSUI,<lb/> estimation procedures of the MAUF for the cur<lb/> rent project followed those in Revicki et al.&apos;s study<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. The conceptual framework and details on the<lb/> method were described elsewhere <ref type="biblio">[16, 17]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Developing the multi-attribute utility function<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(MAUF)<lb/></ref> We applied the person-mean approach for the<lb/> estimation of parameters in structuring the MAUF.<lb/> The person-mean was estimated by 10% trimmed<lb/> mean of the direct preference measures so as to<lb/> minimize central tendency bias caused by outliers<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. Trimmed means of the VAS values and SG<lb/></p>

			<figure>utilities for the single symptom states (VAS values<lb/> only), corner symptom states and multi-symptom<lb/> states provided the basis of parameters to construct<lb/> the mathematical function. A power function was<lb/> used to establish the fitted disvalue-disutility rela<lb/> tionship (disvalue = 1 -value; disutility = 1 -util<lb/> ity) and the log function, In (1 -u) = ol [In (1 -v)]<lb/> where v equals to values and u equals to utilities. A<lb/> linear regression model with no intercept was esti<lb/> mated using the data of the five corner states and the<lb/> five multi-symptom states. The standard form for a<lb/> five-attribute multiplicative disutility function is<lb/> shown as follows:<lb/> 0=(l/c) f[(l + CCj?j) -I<lb/> L/=i<lb/> l+c = PJ(l+cc/) j=l<lb/> D is the disutility index where the scale is 0.00 for<lb/> perfect health and 1.0 for the all-worst state.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Each ?j is the single attribute disutility function<lb/> for the attribute j on a scale where the best level<lb/> has a disutility of 0.00 and the worst level has a<lb/> disutility of 1.0, where c and Cj are the model<lb/> parameters. Each Cj is a scalar constant in con<lb/> junction with the corner state j that also contrib<lb/> utes to the weightings of the conditional single<lb/> attribute utilities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Psychometric evaluation<lb/></head>

			<p>Psychometric evaluation of the Chinese-based<lb/> RSUI included test-retest reliability, discriminant<lb/> and convergent validity. Test-retest reliability<lb/> (stability) was estimated by the calculation of the<lb/> intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref> which<lb/> reflects both degree of correspondence and agree<lb/> ment among ratings <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. A coefficient of 0.70 is an<lb/> acceptable indicator of stability for a patient<lb/> reported outcome instrument <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>. An agreement<lb/> between the predicted (RSUI) and directly mea<lb/> sured (SG) utility scores was also tested with ICC.<lb/></p>

			<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures were<lb/> utilized to test the ability of the RSUI to dis<lb/> criminate among different levels of disease severity<lb/> and between those who did and did not require<lb/> medications to control symptoms in the past<lb/> 14 days. Inter-rater reliability in the severity rat<lb/> ings between the two physicians was assessed by<lb/> the calculation of ICC. Convergent validity was<lb/> examined Pearson product-moment correlations<lb/> between RSUI and SF-36 domain scores. A low<lb/> correlation was considered &lt; 0.35, and a moderate<lb/> correlation was considered in the range 0.35-0.50<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>. r-Tests were used to compare mean VAS<lb/> preferences and SG utility scores for the directly<lb/> measured states between the Chinese and US<lb/> samples. Mean RSUI scores were calculated based<lb/> on the Chinese-and US-based MAUF. The sig<lb/> nificant difference between the outcomes resulting<lb/> from the two functions within subjects was tested<lb/> by paired ?-test. The association between the two<lb/> outcomes was analyzed with Pearson product<lb/> moment correlation. Statistical significances were<lb/> determined by a/7-value of &lt;0.05.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>

			<p>Of the 116 subjects who participated in the study,<lb/> only 112 (59 females and 53 males) were included<lb/> in the analysis because the SG interviews of 4<lb/> subjects (3.5%) were of poor quality. Data quality<lb/> was determined by respondent self-assessment and<lb/> interviewer judgment. The mean age of the study<lb/> subjects was 37.6 ? 11.5 years (range 18-62 years).<lb/> About 18% (n = 21) of the participants achieved a<lb/> university degree. Four subjects (3.6%) had never<lb/> received formal education. The remainder of the<lb/> participants attained either primary (21.4%) or<lb/> secondary educational levels (56.3%).<lb/></p>

			<head>Direct preference measures and MA UF<lb/></head>

			<p>The 10% trimmed means (5% trimmed off of each<lb/> end of the distribution) of the direct VAS prefer<lb/> ences and SG utilities for the corner symptom<lb/> states and multiple symptom states are shown in<lb/> Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. All SG utility scores were higher than the<lb/> VAS values. Severe stuffy nose and severe runny<lb/> nose were rated worse than the other corner states<lb/> for both VAS preferences and SG utilities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The regression model for estimating utilities<lb/> from VAS preferences resulted in a R2 of 0.979 and<lb/> an unstandardized regression coefficient, of 2.926.<lb/> This coefficient was used in the power function to<lb/> estimate utilities for the within attribute (symp<lb/> tom) levels (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/> We then applied the standard form for a five<lb/> attribute disutility function. The multiplicative<lb/> model best fits the preference data, based on the<lb/> derived parameters c = -0.814, ci=0.40, c2 = 0.40,<lb/> c3 = 0.32, c4 = 0.32, c5 = 0.31, This resulted in a<lb/> multiplicative MAUF for the Chinese-based<lb/> RSUI =1.228 (Si x S2x S3x S4x S5)-0.228,<lb/> where RSUI is the derived utility for the symptom<lb/> states on a scale that the best symptom state (no<lb/> symptoms) has a score of 1 and the worst possible<lb/> symptom state (severe symptoms for 8-14 days)<lb/> has a score of 0; and Si is the score for the level on<lb/> symptom i. Table <ref type="table">3</ref> displays all the coefficients of<lb/> Si for the rhinitis classification system. The derived<lb/> RSUI is the score calculated from the MAUF and<lb/> rhinitis classification system.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reliability<lb/></head>

			<p>Rhinitis symptoms often may fluctuate from day<lb/> to day. Twenty-six percent of our subjects reported<lb/> improvement and 14.3% reported worsening over<lb/> a 2-week period. In the examination of test-retest<lb/> reliability, we only included those subjects (n = 66)<lb/> who reported more or less the same rhinitis status<lb/> when comparing with their condition at baseline.<lb/> The ICC, indicating the 2-week reproducibility of<lb/> the RSUI, was 0.71 (p&lt; 0.001).<lb/></p>

			<head>Validity<lb/></head>

			<p>The direct utility measures and the derived RSUI<lb/> scores for the corner and multi-symptom states are<lb/> displayed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. The differences between the<lb/> utility scores obtained from the direct SG and<lb/> those derived by the RSUI MAUF ranged from<lb/> -0.07 to 0.00. The standard deviations among the<lb/> differences for the corner states and multi-symp<lb/> tom states were 0.06 and 0.04, respectively. The<lb/> agreement between the predicted RSUI and di<lb/> rectly measured SG utility scores for the multi<lb/> symptom states was high (ICC = 0.98, p&lt; 0.001).<lb/></p>

			<p>Using the Chinese-based MAUF in scoring<lb/> rhinitis symptoms, the generated RSUI mean score<lb/> for the study group was 0.70 (SD = 0.22) and the<lb/> median score was 0.76. RSUI scores did not sig<lb/> nificantly vary by gender (p = 0.064) or age<lb/> {p = 0.703). Moreover, no significant correlations<lb/> were detected between RSUI scores and years<lb/> experiencing rhinitis {p = 0.723) nor age of onset of<lb/> rhinitis {p = 0.591). Table <ref type="table">4</ref> summarizes the mean<lb/> RSUI scores by physician-rated and patient self<lb/> rated severity in rhinitis status. There was a fairly<lb/> strong association between the physician-rated<lb/> and patient self-rated severity scores (r = 0.65,<lb/> p&lt; 0.001). Mean RSUI scores varied significantly<lb/> by both physician-rated {p&lt; 0.001) and patient<lb/> rated severity of rhinitis symptoms (/?&lt; 0.001).<lb/> Inter-rater agreement between the two physician<lb/> ratings was only moderate (ICC = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001).<lb/> Significant discrimination properties in the RSUI<lb/> were also detected based on the two independent<lb/> physician-ratings (/? = 0.004 and p&lt; 0.001, respec<lb/> tively). The RSUI scores were correlated with the<lb/> patient self-rated VAS scores for their current<lb/> rhinitis status (r = 0.59, /?&lt;0.001). Mean RSUI<lb/> scores differentiated between the patients who did<lb/> (mean RSUI = 0.68) and did not require medica<lb/> tions (mean RSUI = 0.78) to control symptoms in<lb/> the past 2 weeks (/? = 0.031).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the examination of convergent validity, there<lb/> were weak to moderate correlations between RSUI<lb/> and the majority of the SF-36 dimensions. Signif<lb/> icant correlations were detected between RSUI<lb/> and bodily pain (r = 0.25, p = 0.009), general health<lb/> (r = 0.37, /&gt;&lt;0.001), vitality (r = 0.27, p = 0.003),<lb/> social functioning (r = 0.25, p = 0.009), role emo<lb/> tional (r = 0.19, p = 0.041), and mental health<lb/> (r = 0.20, p = 0.035). No significant correlations<lb/> were observed between the RSUI and physical<lb/> functioning (p = 0.298) or role physical score<lb/> (p = 0.154).<lb/></p>

			<head>Comparison between Chinese-and US-based<lb/> preferences and RSUI scores<lb/></head>

			<p>The directly measured VAS preferences and SG<lb/> utilities for the five corner states and the five multi<lb/> symptom states were compared between the<lb/> Chinese and US samples. There were statistically<lb/> significant differences in mean VAS preference<lb/> scores for all of these health states (all p &lt; 0.05; not<lb/> shown).

Differences in SG utilities ranged from<lb/> 0.02 to 0.14.<lb/> When the US-based MAUF [10] was used to<lb/> score rhinitis symptoms for the Chinese subjects in<lb/> the current study, the mean RSUI score was lower,<lb/> 0.63 (SD = 0.21). There was a statistically signifi<lb/> cant mean difference of 0.07 (range from -0.06 to<lb/> 0.23; p&lt; 0.001) when compared to the RSUI<lb/> scores based on the Chinese MAUF. A highly<lb/> significant correlation was observed between the<lb/> RSUI scores from the US-based and Chinese<lb/> based functions (r = 0.96, p&lt; 0.001), and the ICC<lb/> was 0.90 (p&lt; 0.001).<lb/> Discussion<lb/> This study developed the RSUI scoring system<lb/> based on patient preferences from a Chinese Hong<lb/> Kong sample. Few study subjects were unable to<lb/> complete the utility assessment interview. The de<lb/> rived RSUI scores appeared to have slightly un<lb/> der-predicted the directly measured utilities as<lb/> many of the MAUF-SG differences were negative.<lb/> The differences however were very minimal. Pre<lb/> dictive validity of the MAUF model should be<lb/> evaluated with the use of inter-survey groups in<lb/> future research. In the evaluation of reliability, the<lb/> Chinese RSUI exhibited good reproducibility over<lb/> 2 weeks in subjects that remained clinically stable<lb/> (based on self-reports). In the validity evaluation,<lb/> we demonstrated that the RSUI scores varied<lb/> significantly by rhinitis-related severity rated by<lb/> both clinicians and patients. In all cases, patients<lb/> reporting more severe rhinitis status also had sig<lb/> nificantly lower (worse) RSUI scores compared to<lb/> those with less severe rhinitis. The consistency in<lb/> association between rhinitis severities rated by<lb/> patients and physicians provides strong supportive<lb/> evidence for the validity of the RSUI scores. The<lb/> RSUI scores also were significantly worse in pa<lb/> tients who required medication therapy to control<lb/> their rhinitis symptoms, providing additional<lb/> supportive evidence for validity.<lb/></figure>

			<p>There are few studies comparing the preferences<lb/> of Asian and Western subjects for different health<lb/> states. Furlong and colleagues <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref> examined the<lb/> results from the literature in regard to the MAUFs<lb/> constructed for the generic instruments between<lb/> different Western countries and concluded that<lb/> these functions were fairly similar. However, it is<lb/> less certain that this conclusion can be generalized<lb/> to Asian countries. In this article, we compared the<lb/> directly measured preference scores between the<lb/> US and Hong Kong samples and found significant<lb/> differences in the VAS and SG scores. There may<lb/> be cultural differences between the US and Chinese<lb/> respondents, as well as differences in demographic<lb/> and clinical characteristics. For example, while the<lb/> age and gender distributions were similar between<lb/> the two samples, the US subjects were more edu<lb/> cated. Forty-four percent of the US subjects held a<lb/> university degree (and 32% had some college)<lb/> compared with 18% of the Chinese sample. The<lb/> differences in the preference scores could also be<lb/> due to the variations between the preference<lb/> measuring methods, e.g. in-person interviews vs.<lb/> computer-interactive interviews. We tried to min<lb/> imize the differences between the two modes of<lb/> administration by simulating Revicki et al.&apos;s tra<lb/> ditional assessment method <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref> in the warm up<lb/> exercises.<lb/></p>

			<p>For the VAS preference ratings of corner states,<lb/> Chinese subjects consistently rated the states as 9<lb/> 12% more preferable than the US subjects. For the<lb/> SG utilities, the scores obtained from the Chinese<lb/> and US populations varied and differed substan<lb/> tially for the state involving itchy-watery eyes.<lb/> These observed difference in the scoring patterns<lb/> of the five corner states in SG utilities may be due<lb/> to geographic variations in disease characteristics,<lb/> where the US subjects rated itchy-watery eyes as<lb/> worse and the Chinese rated stuffy nose and runny<lb/> nose as worse. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is com<lb/> monly seen in the US <ref type="biblio">[9, 24]</ref> and it usually induces<lb/> relatively more ocular symptoms especially during<lb/> the pollen season <ref type="biblio">[6, 25, 26]</ref>. Cases of seasonal<lb/> allergic rhinitis are rarely seen in Hong Kong.<lb/></p>

			<p>Instead, perennial allergic rhinitis mostly induced<lb/> by house dust mite is common <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>. In the Hong<lb/> Kong clinical experience, the most frequent com<lb/> plaints from patients are nasal obstruction and<lb/> runny nose. This is consistent with the patterns of<lb/> SG utilities seen in this study. In the current study,<lb/> 30% of our subjects did not have any eye-related<lb/> problems, and this is the highest free-of-symptom<lb/> ratio among all other symptoms (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore, because of the lower prevalence of<lb/> itchy-watery eyes in these patients, they may be of<lb/> less concern.<lb/></p>

			<p>The diversity of patient preferences in SG mea<lb/> sures contributed to the different weightings for<lb/> the utility-scoring functions between the two cul<lb/> tures. The MAUF for the Chinese RSUI was<lb/> somewhat different from that derived based on the<lb/> original US study sample. This resulted in a sig<lb/> nificant difference in the rhinitis outcome in the<lb/> Chinese subjects between using the US-and Chi<lb/> nese-based RSUI. Our findings revealed that use<lb/> of the US-based scoring algorithm would overes<lb/> timate the severity of rhinitis outcomes for Chinese<lb/> subjects. Based on the US RSUI calculation, the<lb/> majority of our subjects (89%) had comparatively<lb/> worse scores, while 9% of the study group (n= 10)<lb/> had better rhinitis scores. It was observed that<lb/> these 10 patients either reported no eye-related<lb/> symptoms (n = 5) or very mild itchy-watery eyes<lb/> (n = 5). Results indicated that subjects with mod<lb/> erate or severe itchy-watery eyes might have been<lb/> overestimated as more severe on their overall rhi<lb/> nitis index.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, the present study results support<lb/> the reliability and validity of the Chinese-based<lb/> RSUI for the use in the Chinese population. The<lb/> RSUI allows the incorporation of patient prefer<lb/> ences into outcome measurements of rhinitis<lb/> symptoms. The developed MAUF appears to<lb/> reflect directly assessed preferences for rhinitis<lb/> related health states. This study also provides some<lb/> preliminary evidence that MAUFs and preferences<lb/> may vary between US and Asian countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Additional research is needed to examine the nat<lb/> ure and extent of differences in preferences for<lb/> different health states between Asian and Western<lb/> cultures. In the present study, we are not able to<lb/> rule out whether or not the differences between the<lb/> Chinese-and US-based RSUI are associated with<lb/> subject characteristics or different preference<lb/> measurement methods. However, we have ob<lb/> served that patient preferences seem to be affected<lb/> by geographical variations in disease characteris<lb/> tics. Therefore, caution should be taken before the<lb/> application of a disease-specific preference func<lb/> tion from another country. Our results suggested<lb/> that use of the US-based preference function might<lb/> bias the measurement of rhinitis outcomes in the<lb/> Chinese. Based on this study, there is evidence that<lb/> the Chinese RSUI is reproducible and valid. Fur<lb/> ther research is needed to demonstrate the pre<lb/> dictive validity and responsiveness of the RSUI to<lb/> clinically meaningful changes in rhinitis status.<lb/> The RSUI may be useful as a preference-weighted<lb/> outcome measure for clinical and economic studies<lb/> comparing different rhinitis treatments.<lb/></p>
