Ellis 1* , Jean Boursiquot 2 , Stuart Carr 3 , François Graham 4 and Marie-Soleil Masse 4 <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Background: The Allergy Patient Identification for Immunotherapy (AsPIRe) program was a parallel physician and <lb/>patient survey. The objectives were to examine physician and patient perceptions of seasonal allergy symptoms <lb/>and their impact on patients, and to examine patient and physician attitudes to allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for <lb/>seasonal allergies. AsPIRe was led by a steering committee and received research ethics board clearance from Queen&apos;s <lb/>University. <lb/>Methods: Allergists (17) from across Canada enrolled in the AsPIRe program and completed an on-line survey <lb/>to collect demographic information and baseline perceptions. Allergists then recruited patients and completed <lb/>paper-based parallel physician and patient questionnaires. Patients received an AIT informational booklet with their <lb/>questionnaire. Patients who were AIT-naïve with no contraindication to AIT and 12 years of age and older met the <lb/>inclusion criteria. <lb/>Results: The survey was in field from February 2018 to June 2018. A total of 141 allergist surveys and 136 patient <lb/>surveys were completed. Mean age of patients was 30 years old (range 12-70). Fifty-seven percent of patients <lb/>reported prior knowledge of AIT. Seventy-two percent of patients reported seasonal allergies of longer than 5 years <lb/>duration and in this subset of patients, 46% were at their first allergist visit. Seventy-three percent of all patients <lb/>indicated they would be likely or very likely to try sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), if recommended by their allergist <lb/>compared to 36% for subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). Conversely, 10% of patients reported they would be <lb/>unlikely or very unlikely to try SLIT compared to 46% of patients who would be unlikely or very unlikely to try SCIT if <lb/>recommended by their allergist. <lb/>Conclusions: In this particular study cohort, there was a gap in perception between allergists and their patients as <lb/>to the impact of allergy symptoms on daily life. Patients reported being more frequently impacted vs. their physician&apos;s <lb/>assessment. When asked about preference for AIT options, Canadian patients reported they were more likely to follow <lb/>their allergists&apos; recommendation for initiation of SLIT compared to SCIT. <lb/>Keywords: Allergen immunotherapy, Patient preference, Seasonal allergies, Allergist preference, Hay fever, Allergic <lb/>rhinitis, Sublingual immunotherapy, Subcutaneous immunotherapy <lb/>© The Author(s) 2020.

			<body>Page 2 of 5 <lb/>Ellis et al. Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol <lb/>(2020) 16:15 <lb/>structured telephone interview of 3671 Canadians over <lb/>the age of 18 [5]. <lb/>Allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms present a substantial <lb/>burden to patients&apos; everyday lives. When comparing the <lb/>burden of allergic rhinitis to depression, hypertension <lb/>and diabetes mellitus, allergic rhinitis was second <lb/>only to depression in its impact on work productivity <lb/>and restriction of daily activities [2]. An online survey <lb/>examined the impact of nasal and ocular allergy <lb/>symptoms in 1001 patients [3]. Fifty percent of patients <lb/>reported impaired daily activities and/or increased <lb/>distraction, irritability, fatigue and frustration as a result <lb/>of symptoms [3]. Allergic rhinitis symptoms have also <lb/>been found to negatively impact both sexual function and <lb/>sleep as evaluated by the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index, <lb/>a validated outcomes tool [4]. <lb/>Despite treatment, a high percentage of AR patients <lb/>have uncontrolled symptoms. In a structured telephone <lb/>interview of Canadian patients with physician diagnosed <lb/>allergic rhinitis, 66% indicated that their lifestyle was <lb/>limited despite using medications for their allergies and <lb/>61% felt their symptoms were only somewhat or poorly/ <lb/>not controlled [5]. <lb/>Allergen specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only <lb/>allergy treatment that modifies the underlying disease <lb/>process [6]. Two forms of AIT are approved for use in <lb/>Canada, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) <lb/>via injection, or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) <lb/>delivered in a tablet form. <lb/>The Allergy Patient Identification for Immunotherapy <lb/>(AsPIRe) Program investigated similarities and <lb/>differences between allergist and patient perceptions <lb/>of seasonal allergy symptoms and their impact on daily <lb/>living. The program also looked at patient and physician <lb/>attitudes toward available allergen immunotherapy <lb/>(AIT) modalities and patients&apos; likely acceptance of AIT if <lb/>offered as part of a seasonal allergy treatment approach. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Thirty-nine allergists from across Canada were invited to <lb/>participate in the AsPIRe Program. Twenty-nine enrolled <lb/>and completed an on-line survey to collect demographic <lb/>information and baseline perceptions. Nineteen allergists <lb/>recruited patients who met the inclusion criteria: AIT-<lb/>naïve seasonal allergy patients with no contraindication <lb/>to AIT and at least 12 years of age. <lb/>For each patient who was selected to participate <lb/>and met the inclusion criteria, the allergist and <lb/>patient completed paper-based parallel allergist and <lb/>patient questionnaires. Patients also received an AIT <lb/>informational booklet with their questionnaire. The <lb/>allergist survey was 7 questions in length and the patient <lb/>survey consisted of 12 questions (surveys available as <lb/>Additional files 1, 2). <lb/>Results were tabulated and where comparable <lb/>questions were posed to both the patient and physician, <lb/>cross-tabulations of the results were done to examine any <lb/>similarities or patterns in the responses. A p-value test <lb/>was done to evaluate diagonal symmetry between the <lb/>patient and physician distribution of responses. A p-value <lb/>that is greater than 0.05 means there is no evidence for <lb/>lack of symmetry. <lb/>Following tabulation of the parallel allergist and patient <lb/>paper-based surveys, the results were communicated to <lb/>the participating allergists. <lb/>Results <lb/>Baseline characteristics <lb/>The survey was in field from February 2018 to June 2018. <lb/>A total of 141 allergist surveys and 136 patient surveys <lb/>were completed. Provincial breakdown of surveys <lb/>returned was 40% from Ontario, Alberta 24%, Quebec <lb/>24% and British Columbia 12%. The mean age of patients <lb/>was 30 years old (range 12-70), and 44% were male, <lb/>56% female. 72% of patients reported seasonal allergies <lb/>of longer than 5 years duration and in this subset of <lb/>patients, 46% were at their first allergist visit. <lb/>Impact of allergy symptoms <lb/>When questioned about the impact of specific symptoms, <lb/>both patients and allergists rated nasal symptoms as the <lb/>most bothersome. On a five-point scale, the mean was <lb/>calculated and patients reported blocked nose (3.9) and <lb/>sneezing (3.7) as the most bothersome while allergists <lb/>rated blocked nose (3.7) and runny nose (3.4) as the <lb/>most bothersome. Conversely, headaches and quantity <lb/>and quality of sleep were rated least bothersome by both <lb/>patients and allergists. Agreement between the patient <lb/>and allergist was highest for blocked nose being the <lb/>most bothersome symptom (p-value test of symmetry <lb/>p = 0.66). <lb/>Analysis of the data showed that while 40% of patients <lb/>reported being affected by their allergy symptoms <lb/>6-7 days a week, only 14% of allergists felt their patients <lb/>suffered with a similar frequency (Fig. 1). Both allergists <lb/>and patients reported attendance and performance at <lb/>work and school as the quality of life factors the least <lb/>impacted on a daily basis by their allergy symptoms. <lb/>Awareness of AIT <lb/>Fifty-eight percent of patients reported they were aware <lb/>of AIT before completing the survey. Of the 58% who <lb/>were aware of AIT, 49% had been informed by their <lb/>allergist while 26% had heard about AIT from friends <lb/></body>

			<body>and family (Fig. 2). Of note, only 7% of patients had been <lb/>made aware of AIT by the internet. <lb/>Patient preference for type of AIT <lb/>Patient responses showed that 76% of patients indicated <lb/>they would be likely or very likely to try sublingual <lb/>immunotherapy (SLIT) if recommended by their allergist <lb/>compared to 31% for subcutaneous immunotherapy <lb/>(SCIT) (Figs. 3 and 4). <lb/>Conversely, 8% of patients reported they would be <lb/>unlikely or very unlikely to try SLIT compared to 50% <lb/>of patients who would be unlikely or very unlikely to try <lb/>SCIT if recommended by their allergist. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Comparing the patient and physician questionnaires <lb/>demonstrated a gap in perception between allergists <lb/>and their patients as to the impact of allergy symptoms <lb/>on daily life. In this cohort, compared to their allergists, <lb/>patients were nearly 3 times more likely to report that <lb/>allergy symptoms impacted their daily life 6-7 days a <lb/>week. The magnitude of difference between the impact <lb/>on daily life assessed by allergists and the impact <lb/>reported by patients would be expected to be of clinical <lb/>significance. This underscores that patients are not as <lb/>well controlled as their allergists may conclude. <lb/>To provide patients with better allergic rhinitis control, <lb/>their management requires collaboration between <lb/>allergists and patients, including a presentation of all <lb/>Fig. 1 Physician and patient response: effect of symptoms on daily <lb/>life (daily living activities/regular day-to-day life) <lb/>Fig. 2 Patient awareness of AIT: source of information <lb/>Fig. 3 Likelihood to use SLIT: allergist likelihood to prescribe versus <lb/>patient likelihood to use <lb/>Fig. 4 Likelihood to use SCIT: allergist likelihood to prescribe versus <lb/>patient likelihood to use <lb/></body>

			<body>therapeutic options. The Canadian Society of Allergy <lb/>and Clinical Immunology recommends immunotherapy <lb/>should be considered in patients whose rhinitis and lower <lb/>airway symptoms are triggered by allergen exposure and <lb/>who have not achieved sufficient control with or have not <lb/>tolerated conventional pharmacotherapy, or do not want <lb/>to be on ongoing or long-term pharmacotherapy [6]. <lb/>Patients showed a c preference for initiating SLIT vs <lb/>SCIT if it were to be recommended by their allergist. Half <lb/>of patients were not likely or not at all likely to initiate <lb/>SCIT if it were to be recommended by their allergist. <lb/>In contrast, only 8% of patients were not likely or not <lb/>at all likely to follow their allergist&apos;s recommendation <lb/>to initiate with SLIT. These results support the patient <lb/>preference for SLIT inferred by Damm et al. [7] from <lb/>their discrete choice study showing preferences for fewer <lb/>physician visits and visits of shorter duration as their <lb/>preferred attributes of an AIT. <lb/>There are clear limitations to this study. Firstly, we <lb/>had a small sample size and potential selection bias. <lb/>Allergists who were approached to participate were <lb/>known to be more generally receptive to participating <lb/>in studies and to prescribing AIT. Geographical <lb/>representation was not uniform across the country as <lb/>surveys were only completed by allergists and patients in <lb/>the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and <lb/>Quebec. A further limitation was the non-randomized <lb/>patient selection. Participating allergists decided which <lb/>individual patients to approach for participation and <lb/>this could have introduced selection bias. Additionally, <lb/>while the questionnaires used in the parallel physician-<lb/>patient survey were developed by the steering committee <lb/>members based on their clinical experience, and available <lb/>in English and French based on patient preference, they <lb/>were not validated tools. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>In this particular study cohort, there was a gap in <lb/>perception between allergists and their patients as to the <lb/>impact of allergy symptoms on daily life. Patients reported <lb/>being more frequently impacted versus their physician&apos;s <lb/>assessment. When asked about preference for AIT <lb/>options, this cohort of Canadian patients reported they <lb/>were more likely to follow their allergists&apos; recommendation <lb/>for initiation of SLIT compared to SCIT. <lb/></body>
