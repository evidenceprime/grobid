	<div type="abstract">Purpose of review<lb/> Patient and physician perspectives on the impact of allergic rhinitis have previously been<lb/> studied in the general population. We evaluated the burden of allergic rhinitis among<lb/> patients from the members of European allergy patient organizations. The Patient Voice<lb/> Allergy Survey was a quantitative, self-completion survey of 3562 patients with allergic<lb/> rhinitis (16 years and older). Background information on allergic rhinitis, severity of<lb/> allergic rhinitis symptoms and their impact on lives, nonmedical measures for relieving of<lb/> symptoms, types of medications, and concomitant conditions were evaluated.<lb/> Recent findings<lb/> Almost 50% of the responders reported symptoms lasting for more than a season.<lb/> Preventive household adjustments are expensive with little perceived benefit. Sleep and<lb/> emotional life are affected by allergic rhinitis. Most patients are satisfied with the current<lb/> allergic rhinitis medications; at least one-fifth report dissatisfaction. Patients perceive<lb/> that allergic rhinitis worsens other concomitant allergic diseases.<lb/> Summary<lb/> Future management guidelines for allergic rhinitis must take into account the results of<lb/> this survey. Such guidelines must promote relief from the emotional burden of allergic<lb/> rhinitis and from the negative impact on daily activities, encourage patient education,<lb/> and maintain and build on the strong partnership between patients and healthcare<lb/> professionals.<lb/></div>
