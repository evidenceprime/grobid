			<front>Patient Perceptions of Allergic Rhinitis and Quality of Life <lb/>Findings From a Survey Conducted in Europe and the United States <lb/>G. Walter Canonica,* Joaquim Mullol, || Andre ´Pradalier,þ and Alain Didier § <lb/>Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common, costly, and trou-<lb/>blesome condition, impairing patients&apos; quality of life (QoL), <lb/>cognitive function, and productivity. Patients with AR report dis-<lb/>turbed sleep, fatigue, irritability, and a range of practical problems. <lb/>However, there is a relative lack of data on how patients with AR <lb/>perceive their QoL. <lb/>Objective: To better understand how patients perceive AR and their <lb/>attitudes toward this condition (including QoL) and its treatment <lb/>options. <lb/>Methods: An online and telephone survey of 3635 people identified <lb/>as having outdoor and indoor allergies, urticaria, and/or pet allergies <lb/>was performed in 6 countries. <lb/>Results: The survey confirmed that patients with allergies perceive <lb/>their symptoms as causing significant disruptions to their daily lives. <lb/>Respondents were affected for a considerable part of each day, with <lb/>the most severe symptoms occurring in the morning. The most im-<lb/>portant desired effect of medication was the restoration of normal <lb/>breathing, and the most highly rated attributes of the Bideal[ AR drug <lb/>were efficacy, safety, and freedom from undesirable side effects. <lb/>Conclusions: The information gathered from allergy sufferers who <lb/>participated in this survey sheds light on the degree to which people <lb/>with allergies are affected by their disease and the limitations imposed <lb/>by associated symptoms. <lb/>Key Words: allergic rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis, quality of life <lb/>(WAO Journal 2008;138Y144) <lb/></front>

			<body>I n clinical trials of allergic rhinitis (AR), quality of life (QoL) <lb/>is assessed by questionnaires that ask subjects about the <lb/>effects of AR on various domains of their daily lives, including <lb/>practical functions, social interactions, emotional well-being, <lb/>and economic activity. These instruments comprise both ge-<lb/>neric questionnaires that measure physical, mental, and psy-<lb/>chosocial functioning, such as the Medical Outcomes Study <lb/>36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, 1,2 and ones that are more <lb/>disease specific, such as the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of <lb/>Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), Rhinasthma, and the Rhinosinu-<lb/>sitis Disability Index. 3Y5 The effects of AR on health-related <lb/>QoL extend to learning, sleep, vitality/alertness, perception of <lb/>general health, cognitive and emotional functioning, and psy-<lb/>chomotor performance. 6Y8 Strong, highly significant correla-<lb/>tions have been found between clinical AR symptoms and <lb/>QoL. 6 Such limitations on daily functioning can have negative <lb/>effects on a person&apos;s performance at home, school, or work, <lb/>which have both a direct and an indirect economic impact on <lb/>society. 9 <lb/>An online survey conducted in 2004 to assess QoL in <lb/>2002 patients with AR and nasal congestion (or their care-<lb/>givers) has reinforced these findings. 10 Within the subgroup <lb/>of working adults (n = 1043), 59% reported that their con-<lb/>gestion had affected their job performance. Of the 446 <lb/>caregivers, 42% said that congestion led to their child&apos;s poor <lb/>productivity in school. Nasal congestion associated with AR <lb/>also led to feelings of discomfort, frustration, fatigue, irri-<lb/>tability, and stress. 10 A Swedish survey of 9538 adolescents <lb/>with AR and/or asthma found that severe nasal symptoms <lb/>were associated with lower grades in school. 11 <lb/>Although the typical clinical symptoms of AR might <lb/>be considered relatively inconsequential, they are consistently <lb/>mentioned by patients as having a significant impact on QoL. <lb/>Thus, there may be a disconnect between clinicians&apos; percep-<lb/>tions of AR as a chronic but nonserious medical condition that <lb/>causes a limited range of symptoms and patients&apos; perceptions <lb/>of it as a limiting and disabling presence in their lives. This <lb/>disconnect may in turn lead to suboptimal treatment. <lb/>To address the way health care providers and patients <lb/>perceive the effects of AR, a multinational survey, BUnder-<lb/>standing the Dynamics of Allergy Suffering and Treatment,[ <lb/>conducted by the Forbes Consulting Group, was undertaken. <lb/>The objective was to better understand patients&apos; attitudes and <lb/>perceptions about the symptoms and effects of AR, treatment <lb/>approaches, and available therapies. The survey investigated <lb/>respondents&apos; product or brand choices and what form of the-<lb/>rapy they preferred (eg, tablets, nasal sprays). Some method-<lb/>ologic flexibility to define concepts was permitted within each <lb/>country. <lb/></body>

			<body>75 from nontreaters. The actual number of complete responses <lb/>received was 3635. Respondent panels were recruited in a way <lb/>that the geographic distribution of the panel within each coun-<lb/>try accurately reflected the population distribution. <lb/>The survey was conducted by Internet, except in Spain, <lb/>where it was conducted by telephone. To ensure uniformity of <lb/>responses and to control for scale-use bias, scale variables <lb/>were standardized, setting the mean within each variable and <lb/>within each observation to zero and the SD to 1. A follow-up <lb/>interview was conducted by Internet in the United States in <lb/>November 2005. <lb/>Respondents were included only if they had experienced <lb/>symptoms related to outdoor, indoor, pet, mold, or dust aller-<lb/>gies, including AR and urticaria, during the preceding <lb/>12 months. People who primarily had food, insect, or medica-<lb/>tion allergies were excluded. <lb/>Survey participants answered questions on the fre-<lb/>quency and duration of symptoms, the times of day and the <lb/>season(s) in which they occurred, and what types of symp-<lb/>toms they experienced. They were given a list of the core <lb/>allergy symptoms and were asked to note which ones they <lb/>had: sneezing, itchy/watery eyes, nasal congestion, runny <lb/>nose, sinus congestion, postnasal drip, sinus pressure, itchy <lb/>throat, sinus pain, and hives/rash. Patients were also asked to <lb/>use a list of 9 possible responses to rate the emotional impact <lb/>of their morning allergy symptoms: more irritable, more <lb/>fatigued, less motivated, less energetic, hard to concentrate, <lb/>more frustrated, less alert, more self-conscious, and feelings <lb/>not affected. There were questions about how disruptive nasal <lb/>allergies in general (and congestion specifically) were to <lb/>various aspects of everyday life, including sleep, participation <lb/>in social and outdoor activities, and mood. Data were weight-<lb/>ed to age, sex, and household income distributions. Respon-<lb/>dents in the United States were subdivided according to 3 <lb/>levels of symptom severity (mild, moderate, and severe). <lb/>Lifestyle impact was calculated with index scores based <lb/>on symptoms and lifestyle disruption. The prevalence of spe-<lb/>cific symptoms was multiplied by symptom severity and was <lb/>indexed against the overall average to create individual index <lb/>scores for the various symptoms. Prevalence of lifestyle dif-<lb/>ficulties was multiplied by disruptiveness and was indexed <lb/>against the overall average to create individual scores. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Demographics <lb/>Respondent demographics are listed in Table 1. The <lb/>percentage of male patients was similar in the 6 countries, but <lb/>the survey participants&apos; ages and overall health varied among <lb/>the countries. <lb/>Incidence <lb/>There was considerable intercountry variability with <lb/>regard to the seasons in which AR was experienced. Forty-<lb/>four percent of respondents in the United States experienced <lb/>3-or 4-season allergies, followed by France (35%), Germany <lb/>(33%), and the United Kingdom (30%), with much lower in-<lb/>cidences reported in Italy (16%) and Spain (11%) (Fig. 1). <lb/>TABLE 1.

			<body>In most countries, the highest percentage of <lb/>respondents experienced allergy symptoms in the spring, led <lb/>by France (92%). The only exception was in the United <lb/>Kingdom, where the highest percentage (89%) reported al-<lb/>lergies during the summer (Fig. 2). <lb/>Respondents in the United States reported having the <lb/>greatest number of days experiencing allergy symptoms per <lb/>year (102), followed by the United Kingdom (79), Germany <lb/>(68), France (62), Italy (37), and Spain (33). Survey parti-<lb/>cipants in the United Kingdom reported the highest number of <lb/>annual days with indoor allergies (160), followed by the <lb/>United States (129), Germany (103), France (67), Italy (59), <lb/>and Spain (36). <lb/>The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma Work-<lb/>shop recommended that the terms seasonal and perennial AR <lb/>be replaced with intermittent AR (IAR) and persistent AR <lb/>(PER). Intermittent AR is defined as the presence of rhinitis <lb/>symptoms for less than 4 days/wk or for less than 4 weeks, <lb/>whereas in PER, rhinitis symptoms are present for greater than <lb/>4 days/wk and for greater than 4 weeks. 12 Table 2 lists the <lb/>distribution of patients with IAR and PER in the 6 study <lb/>countries. Spain had the most patients with IAR (70%), <lb/>whereas both the United Kingdom and the United States had <lb/>the greatest percentage of respondents with PER (53% and <lb/>52%, respectively). This is consistent with the number of <lb/>reported symptom days. <lb/>Diagnosis <lb/>Respondents&apos; rhinitis was largely self-diagnosed in all <lb/>countries surveyed, led by France (74%), followed by the <lb/>United States (72%), Germany (62%), the United Kingdom <lb/>(61%), Italy (60%), and Spain (50%). Spain reported the <lb/>highest percentage of physician diagnoses (46%), followed by <lb/>Italy (41%); only in France did less than one third of res-<lb/>pondents receive a physician diagnosis. The percentage of <lb/>respondents who were diagnosed by a friend or a family <lb/>member varied from 7% in Italy and Spain to 18% in the <lb/>United Kingdom and France. A negligible percentage was <lb/>diagnosed by other means; that is, pharmacist, homeopath, <lb/>physician&apos;s assistant, nurse practitioner, or information ob-<lb/>tained in a physician&apos;s office or from an advertisement. (Res-<lb/>pondents could provide more than 1 answer to this question.) <lb/>Symptoms <lb/>A majority of respondents in all countries reported <lb/>sneezing and itchy/watery eyes to be their most common <lb/>symptoms (sneezing: 64%Y84%; itchy/watery eyes: <lb/>63%Y86%). Other symptoms elicited more varied responses. <lb/>For example, 66% of respondents in the United States reported <lb/>sinus congestion compared with only 12% of those in Spain <lb/>(Fig. 3). <lb/>There was a great amount of intercountry variability <lb/>between the number of participants reporting nasal and sinus <lb/>congestion and sinus pressure and pain. Nasal congestion was <lb/>by far the most common symptom across countries. The <lb/>percentage of positive responses to nasal congestion ranged <lb/>from 43% in France to 68% in the United States. <lb/>Patients in all countries reported that their most severe <lb/>symptoms occurred Bwhen I first wake up in the morning[ or <lb/>Bat other times in the morning.[ Fifty-eight percent of res-<lb/>pondents in Spain and Italy identified the morning hours as the <lb/>time they experienced their worst allergic symptoms, followed <lb/>by France (51%), Germany (48%), and the United Kingdom <lb/>and the United States (both 46%). Lesser percentages were <lb/>noted for severe afternoon, evening, and nighttime allergies <lb/>(Fig. 4). <lb/>FIGURE 2. Time of year when allergy symptoms were experienced. <lb/>TABLE 2.

			<body>However, the nature of morning symptoms varied. Res-<lb/>pondents in France and Spain identified sneezing as their most <lb/>frequent symptom upon rising (60%), whereas in the United <lb/>States it was nasal congestion (56%). More than half of <lb/>Spanish respondents experienced itchy eyes and runny nose <lb/>most frequently in the morning; Spain was the only country <lb/>that reported a 50% or greater response rate for both of these <lb/>symptoms. <lb/>Overall, US participants reported more negative emo-<lb/>tional effects from morning allergies than those surveyed in <lb/>the other 5 countries. In general, irritability and fatigue were <lb/>the most common effects of symptoms, with some variation <lb/>between the countries. Responders in Italy reported a higher <lb/>degree of irritability (58%), followed by the United States <lb/>(55%) and the United Kingdom (53%), compared with only <lb/>24% of responders in Spain. French participants noted the <lb/>highest degree of fatigue (59%), followed by the United States <lb/>(52%); it was identified as a primary morning concern by 31% <lb/>to 44% of patients in the other countries. <lb/>A large percentage of responders reported difficulty in <lb/>falling asleep without trouble, ranging from 47% in Spain to <lb/>26% in Germany and the United Kingdom. When respon-<lb/>dents were asked whether this problem was disruptive, 73% in <lb/>the United States, 71% in France, 68% in Germany, 57% in the <lb/>United Kingdom, and 52% in Italy said that it was; however, <lb/>only 24% of those in Spain (many of whom had reported <lb/>difficulty in falling asleep) said that it was disruptive (Fig. 5). <lb/>From a list of 12 topics on the impact of AR on lifestyle, <lb/>breathing normally was ranked as the first and most common <lb/>difficulty across all countries (Table 3). The topic ranked last <lb/>in all countries was the impact on the ability to take care of <lb/>children. Overall, issues relating to sleep and rest were rated as <lb/>FIGURE 3.

			<body>more difficult than issues relating to social interaction. There <lb/>was considerable divergence about the ability to participate in <lb/>outdoor activities. <lb/>Treatment Regimens <lb/>Despite the large rate of reported self-diagnoses, in all <lb/>countries the highest response to the question BWhy did you <lb/>first try the product you use most often?[ was BDoctor <lb/>recommended/prescribed it.[ This was true for both prescrip-<lb/>tion (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments, with the <lb/>highest percentage of drug choices based on physician <lb/>recommendation occurring in Spain (86% Rx; 76% OTC). <lb/>Spain (66%) and France (62%) had the highest rates of Rx <lb/>drug use, and the United Kingdom had the highest rate of OTC <lb/>drug use (41%). <lb/>In the United Kingdom, 23% of responders selected <lb/>their own medications regardless of physician input, and 28% <lb/>of those in this subgroup chose OTC formulations. Friends <lb/>and pharmacists were also identified as major influences in the <lb/>selection of OTC formulations, but they had a considerably <lb/>smaller influence on Rx drug choice. Advertising had some <lb/>influence when it came to patient choice of OTC medications <lb/>but was much less influential in Rx drug choice. <lb/>When questioned about their preferred form of allergy <lb/>medication (Table 4), most respondents in the 5 European <lb/>countries reported that they had tried tablets/pills/caplets, and <lb/>of that group, a majority expressed preference for this form. In <lb/>France, for example, 77% had taken tablets and 54% preferred <lb/>them, followed by the United Kingdom with 75% reporting <lb/>use and 53% expressing preference. Both German and Italian <lb/>responders had used nasal sprays in larger percentages than <lb/>tablets (71% and 52%, respectively), but neither group pre-<lb/>ferred nasal sprays to tablets. Twenty to 48% of respondents <lb/>across countries also reported having tried eye drops. Much <lb/>smaller percentages of responders had tried other vehicles of <lb/>administration (eg, syrups, throat spray, liquid gels). <lb/>FIGURE 5. Impact of allergies on sleep. <lb/>TABLE 3.

			<body>Respondents from the 5 European countries answered <lb/>questions designed to identify which brands (both prescription <lb/>and OTC) they had used and which ones they had heard of and <lb/>were likely to try in the future. As a rule in all countries, the <lb/>brand that received the highest percentage of positive <lb/>responses tended to achieve the highest degree of preference <lb/>for current and future use. <lb/>Attributes listed by respondents of the ideal drug to treat <lb/>allergies were fairly consistent across all countries. Efficacy, <lb/>rapid onset of action, safety, and lack of side effects were rated <lb/>as the most important attributes. Table 5 lists other desirable <lb/>qualities identified by 80% or greater of allergy sufferers from <lb/>the individual countries. <lb/>Ideal attributes of allergy medications change over time. <lb/>In US respondents, attributes that became more significant <lb/>were relief of symptoms, recommendation by physicians and <lb/>pharmacists, freedom from sedating qualities and other <lb/>adverse effects, and not interfering with a good night&apos;s sleep. <lb/>Some remained unchanged, such as efficacy and safety, and <lb/>others became less significant, including taste, reputation, and <lb/>use by the whole family. <lb/>Although there are many treatment options for AR, it <lb/>remains a largely undertreated condition. The percentage of <lb/>nontreaters in this survey ranged from 11% in the United <lb/>States to 21% in Germany. Reasons that respondents in this <lb/>subgroup did not treat their AR included the following: <lb/>delaying time to seek treatment because they believed that <lb/>their symptoms were unimportant, finding the cost of <lb/>medications too high, or having an inadequate relationship <lb/>with their physician or health care provider. 13 Improving <lb/>communication between clinicians and patients can lead to <lb/>greater use of therapeutic interventions that will aid in <lb/>symptom relief. 13 <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The information gathered from allergy sufferers through <lb/>the present survey supports the observations of many <lb/>clinicians that people with AR perceive their symptoms as <lb/>causing significant QoL disruptions. Allergic rhinitis has an <lb/>unquestionable impact on QoL, including limitations on daily <lb/>activity and decreased productivity at work and school. <lb/>The information provided by QoL questionnaires <lb/>focusing on AR has also made it clear that patients with AR <lb/>are impaired in many domains of their daily lives. 13 Symptoms <lb/>of AR are generally most prevalent in the morning, leading to <lb/>problems throughout the day. In 2005, Long conducted a <lb/>survey of 1000 adults with AR; 65% had symptoms upon <lb/>awakening and 83% of respondents had symptoms throughout <lb/>the morning. 14 Forty-nine percent of those surveyed said that <lb/>their AR was at its worst in the morning. In the subgroup of <lb/>those who experienced symptoms on awakening, 80% felt less <lb/>energetic, 77% more fatigued, 75% less motivated, and 74% <lb/>more irritable than usual. 14 In the present survey, participants <lb/>reported that all symptoms were most severe when they first <lb/>woke up in the morning or during other times in the morning. <lb/>Respondents in all countries said they had experienced <lb/>difficulty in falling asleep. Sleep disturbances are commonly <lb/>noted in patients with AR and contribute to a reduction in <lb/>QoL. 15 One survey involving nearly 5000 subjects with AR <lb/>found that those who frequently had symptoms at night were <lb/>significantly more likely to report habitual snoring, chronic <lb/>excessive daytime sleepiness, or chronic nonrestorative sleep <lb/>(P G 0.0001). 16 A smaller study comparing subjects with <lb/>TABLE 4.

			<body>seasonal AR (SAR) with healthy volunteers found a <lb/>statistically significant relation between nighttime sleep <lb/>disruption and daytime sleepiness in those with SAR (P = <lb/>0.048). However, the daytime sleepiness could be related to <lb/>the SAR symptoms as well as the impaired sleep. 17 <lb/>A recent 2-week study of 483 subjects with AR <lb/>randomized to desloratadine 5 mg or placebo found that <lb/>treatment with the second-generation antihistamine deslorata-<lb/>dine significantly improved total RQLQ scores between <lb/>baseline and day 14 (P = 0.0003 vs placebo). Significant <lb/>decreases in RQLQ subdomain scores were also seen with <lb/>desloratadine. 18 In another 2-week study of subjects with SAR <lb/>(N = 688), fexofenadine 120 mg therapy led to significant <lb/>improvements in overall QoL, as measured by the RQLQ (P e <lb/>0.005 vs placebo). 19 <lb/>Given the pervasive adverse effects of AR on function <lb/>and capacity, it is evident that medical treatment for AR should <lb/>address issues beyond clinical outcome measures. One of the <lb/>chief goals of therapy is to improve patients&apos; well-being and <lb/>their ability to function. Treatment modalities should not only <lb/>provide optimum clinical benefits; they should also increase <lb/>patient satisfaction. 20,21 The allergy treatment outcome that <lb/>survey respondents in all countries desired most was the <lb/>ability to breathe normally; getting restorative sleep was <lb/>ranked second and feeling well rested during the day third. <lb/>Attributes of the ideal AR medication identified by respon-<lb/>dents in most countries included rapid onset of action, safety, <lb/>and minimal bothersome side effects. <lb/>Responses to the survey suggest that AR is often <lb/>perceived as causing daytime fatigue. It is possible that some <lb/>people with AR could be experiencing the sedating effects of <lb/>first-generation antihistamines in addition to the impairment <lb/>and sleep disturbances caused by their symptoms. <lb/>Although not specifically addressed by the survey <lb/>administrators, it should be noted that there are differences <lb/>among the 5 European countries in allergenic pollens. Grass, <lb/>birch, mugwort, and ragweed pollen predominate in central <lb/>Europe and in mountainous areas, whereas olive, cypress, and <lb/>plants in the genus Parietaria dominate in the Mediterranean <lb/>region. 22 Although pollen seasons tend to be shorter in <lb/>northern climates with colder weather, allergy severity varies <lb/>from year to year depending on weather patterns, especially <lb/>rainfall. Due to higher pollution levels, populations in more <lb/>urbanized regions and countries will experience greater <lb/>sensitivity to allergens. 22 These factors may help to explain <lb/>the variation between countries seen in this survey and those <lb/>recently reported in a broader range of countries. 23 <lb/>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Results from this survey highlight the range of allergic <lb/>symptoms that negatively impact the lifestyle of people with <lb/>AR. Patients clearly want treatment options that improve their <lb/>QoL and restore their ability to engage in activities of daily <lb/>living. <lb/></body>
