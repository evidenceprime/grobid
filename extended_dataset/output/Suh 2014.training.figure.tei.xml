            <figDesc>Comparison of effects of Cr(VI) on Fe in rats and mice after 90-days of exposure in drinking water. Effects are shown for total Fe in the duodenum (A), liver (B), and<lb/> serum (C) in rats and mice by their 90-day average daily doses of Cr(VI). The average daily doses of Cr(VI) were based on animal bodyweight, water intake, and administered<lb/> drinking water concentrations of Cr(VI). Dose-dependent decrease in Fe was observed for duodenum, liver, and blood. Ãƒ Significantly different from that of control animals<lb/> (p &lt; 0.05) using the Shirley&apos;s test. Rn, rats; Mm, mice.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Prussian blue staining of bone smears from F344 rats exposed to 0 (A) and 180 mg/L Cr(VI) (B) for 90 days. Blue color represents staining of Fe in macrophages. Note<lb/> that it was difficult to find multiple blue macrophages in one field in the 180 mg/L Cr(VI) treatment group.<lb/> Fig. 3. Fold change expression of select genes in the rat and mouse duodena after 7 and 90 days of exposure to Cr(VI) in drinking water. Open and filled symbols represent<lb/> genes typically expressed on the apical and basolateral epithelial surfaces, respectively. Red and green lines mark 1.5-fold increases or decreases in gene expression,<lb/> respectively. See text for details on gene/protein nomenclature. See Kopec et al. (2012a,b) for methods related to microarray analysis.</figDesc>
