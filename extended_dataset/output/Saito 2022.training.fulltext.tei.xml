			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is commonly<lb/> performed for gastric tumors, <ref type="biblio">1-3</ref> as it facilitates en bloc<lb/> anticoagulants (DOACs), aspirin, and P2Y12 receptor<lb/> antagonists. <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> In 2012, the Japan Gastroenterologi-<lb/>cal Endoscopy Society published the &quot;Guidelines for<lb/> gastroenterological endoscopy in patients undergoing<lb/> antithrombotic treatment.&quot; <ref type="biblio">11</ref> In July 2017, it published<lb/> a supplement <ref type="biblio">12</ref> specifying that DOACs should only be<lb/> discontinued briefly when performing endoscopic pro-<lb/>cedures with a high risk for bleeding. Due to calls to<lb/> verify the validity of these guidelines, we examined<lb/> changes in ESD for gastric tumors after the publication<lb/> of the supplement in a local community hospital.We also<lb/> examined the risk factors for post-ESD bleeding and<lb/> developed a predictive model. Although predictive mod-<lb/>els have been constructed in previous studies, these<lb/> may have been affected by external factors, such as<lb/> changes in the guidelines. Therefore, we aimed to con-<lb/>struct a predictive model and clarify the status of gastric<lb/> ESD at our local community hospital before and after the<lb/> publication of the supplementary guidelines to examine<lb/> the risk factors for bleeding after gastric ESD.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/> Study design<lb/></head>

			<p>This was a retrospective study of gastric ESD cases<lb/> registered in our hospital database. The authors con-<lb/>ducted this study in accordance with the Declaration of<lb/> Helsinki and obtained approval from the hospital&apos;s eth-<lb/>ical review committee. Informed consent was obtained<lb/> from all patients and their families.<lb/></p>

			<head>Description of setting<lb/></head>

			<p>As a core hospital in our region, we targeted local res-<lb/>idents for ESD without distinction. Approximately 100-<lb/>150 gastric ESDs per year were performed by multiple<lb/> gastroenterologists; proficiency varied from trainees to<lb/> experts. Approximately 20 physicians were involved in<lb/> this study.<lb/></p>

			<p>The patients were admitted to the hospital one day<lb/> prior to the procedure. ESD was performed using the<lb/> Olympus-Medical (Tokyo, Japan) Dual knife, Hook knife,<lb/> and IT knife, as per the surgeon&apos;s preference. Sodium<lb/> hyaluronate and saline solution were used for submu-<lb/>cosal injection, and VIO 300D (ERBE, Germany) was<lb/> used to generate high frequencies. Intraoperative anes-<lb/>thesia was administered with small doses of midazolam<lb/> or flunitrazepam as a sedative and pethidine hydrochlo-<lb/>ride as the analgesic. Hemostasis of the ulcer base after<lb/> ESD was achieved through cauterization using hemo-<lb/>static forceps or the clip method;polyglycolic acid sheets<lb/> were occasionally used to cover or close the ulcer base<lb/> when using the clip method. Patients were administered<lb/> 20 mg omeprazole twice daily as they were fasting on<lb/> the day of treatment and the following day.Subsequently,<lb/> omeprazole was replaced with 30 mg oral lansoprazole,<lb/> 20 mg esomeprazole, or 20 mg vonoprazan fumarate<lb/> before meals. Some surgeons performed second-look<lb/> endoscopy the day after treatment. Barring complica-<lb/>tions, most patients were discharged within 5-6 days<lb/> postoperatively.<lb/></p>

			<head>Patient selection<lb/></head>

			<p>We evaluated all cases of ESD performed at our<lb/> hospital between May 2003 and July 2021 that were<lb/> registered in the database. We followed up patients in<lb/> the usual outpatient setting for ≥1 year, barring spe-<lb/>cial circumstances. Patients with submucosal tumors,<lb/> hyperplastic polyps, non-carcinomas or non-adenomas,<lb/> or missing required data were excluded.<lb/></p>

			<p>Cases were divided into two groups: those who under-<lb/>went ESD before and those who underwent ESD after<lb/> July 2017, the time of publication of the supplemen-<lb/>tal guidelines. If multiple lesions were resected en<lb/> bloc, they were considered a single case. Anticoagu-<lb/>lants were defined as warfarin and DOACs (dabigatran,<lb/> rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban).<lb/></p>

			<head>Study variables<lb/></head>

			<p>The variables in this study included patient character-<lb/>istics (age and sex), medications at the time of ESD<lb/> (types of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and steroids),<lb/> comorbidities at the time of ESD (atrial fibrillation,<lb/> valvular disease, deep vein thrombosis, diabetes mel-<lb/>litus, hemodialysis, and liver cirrhosis), lesions (site,<lb/> resection specimen size, procedure time, macroscopic<lb/> type, ulcer, histology, and depth of invasion), and patient<lb/> outcomes (curability of ESD, intraoperative and post-<lb/>operative perforation, postoperative bleeding, death,<lb/> and thromboembolism associated with withdrawal of<lb/> anticoagulants). Antiplatelet agents included aspirin,<lb/> cilostazol, and P2Y12 receptor antagonists. Anticoagu-<lb/>lants and antiplatelet agents were collectively referred<lb/> to as antithrombotic agents. Withdrawal and resumption<lb/> of antithrombotic drugs were based on the guidelines<lb/> and decisions of the attending physicians. However,<lb/> a few patients discontinued the drugs independently<lb/> or extended the withdrawal period at the discretion<lb/> of their physicians. Post-ESD bleeding was defined<lb/> as hematemesis or hemoptysis and a decrease in<lb/> post-ESD peripheral blood hemoglobin level by at least<lb/> 2.0 g/dl.<lb/></p>

			<p>t-test, Wilcoxon test, and chi-square test were used<lb/> to compare the two groups. Risk factors were evalu-<lb/>ated using univariate analysis. The data of the pre-<lb/>publication cohort were used to predict bleeding using a<lb/> logistic regression model. Variables that were significant<lb/> in the univariate analysis and those identified as clini-<lb/>cally significant in previous studies were included in the<lb/> multivariate regression. Receiver-operating characteris-<lb/>tic (ROC) curves were created to evaluate the goodness<lb/> of fit. Bootstrap was used to evaluate the internal valid-<lb/>ity. The prediction model created for the pre-publication<lb/> cohort was applied to the data of the post-publication<lb/> cohort to evaluate the external validity.

			<head>RESULTS<lb/></head>

			<p>Our database included 2423 gastric ESD cases<lb/> between May 2003 and June 2021. We limited gas-<lb/>tric tumors to early carcinomas and adenomas and<lb/> excluded other lesions and those with incomplete data<lb/> and finally included 2272 cases.

			<p>increase in the proportion of patients administered<lb/> DOACs and a decrease in that administered warfarin.<lb/> The proportion of patients with heparin replacement<lb/> decreased, but there was no change in the incidences of<lb/> underlying conditions. A comparison of gastric tumors<lb/> between the groups is summarized in Table <ref type="table">1b</ref>; there<lb/> was an increase in the percentage of lesions in the M<lb/> region, decreased resection specimen size, and reduced<lb/> procedure time. There was also an increase in the pro-<lb/>portion of undifferentiated carcinomas. A comparison of<lb/> outcomes between the groups is presented in Table <ref type="table">1c</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although the perforation rate decreased, there was no<lb/> change in the incidence of post-ESD bleeding. The over-<lb/>all post-ESD bleeding rate was 2.68% (61/2272). Two<lb/> cases of thromboembolism associated with withdrawal<lb/> of anticoagulant agents accounted for 1.28% (2/152) of<lb/> patients administered anticoagulants.<lb/></p>

			<head>Risk factors for post-ESD bleeding<lb/></head>

			<p>Bleeding and non-bleeding cases were compared in the<lb/> pre-and post-publication cohorts, and risk factors were<lb/> examined in the univariate analysis (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Patients<lb/> undergoing heparin replacement or hemodialysis had<lb/> a higher risk for post-ESD bleeding. For anticoagu-<lb/>lants, 18.6% of all warfarin-treated patients experienced<lb/> bleeding, with a significant difference in the propor-<lb/>tion experiencing bleeding in the pre-publication cohort.<lb/> For DOACs, there were fewer cases of bleeding, but<lb/> a significant difference in the proportion of patients<lb/> who experienced bleeding in the post-publication cohort.<lb/> However, there were no clear differences between types<lb/> of DOAC.For lesion-related factors,we found that resec-<lb/>tion specimen size may be a risk factor for post-ESD<lb/> bleeding.<lb/></p>

			<head>Predictive model for post-ESD bleeding<lb/></head>

			<p>In creating the predictive model in the pre-publication<lb/> cohort, we included known risk factors, such as<lb/> antithrombotic agents, heparin replacement, and<lb/> hemodialysis as explanatory variables when perform-<lb/>ing logistic regression analysis. Additionally, we added<lb/> resection specimen size, which was a significant risk<lb/></p>

			<p>The BEST-J score, <ref type="biblio">13</ref> a predictive model with 10 vari-<lb/>ables, had an area under the ROC curve (area under the<lb/> curve [AUC]) of 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-0.93) when applied<lb/> to the post-publication cohort of this study.

			<p>In the final model (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), the risk of bleeding was<lb/> quantified based on the partial regression coefficients<lb/> for each variable.

			<p>Distributions of the risk score and classification in the<lb/> pre-publication cohort are summarized in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The<lb/> bleeding rates at low, intermediate, and high risks were<lb/> 1.6%, 10.3%, and 38.9%, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated a statistically significant difference in both the pre-and post-publication cohorts, with a higher bleeding<lb/> rate in the high-risk group.<lb/></p>

			<p>decrease in the number of patients administered war-<lb/>farin and an increase in those administered DOACs after<lb/> the publication of the supplementary guidelines, there<lb/> was no significant difference in the rate of bleeding after<lb/> gastric ESD. Furthermore, the type of DOAC was not an<lb/> independent risk factor for post-ESD bleeding.<lb/></p>

			<head>Interpretation of results<lb/></head>

			<p>The shortened procedure time and reduced resection<lb/> specimen size may be caused by improvements in the<lb/> ESD techniques. The increase in the number of lesions<lb/> in the M region and in the proportion of undifferentiated<lb/> carcinoma may be due to improvements in endoscopic<lb/> performance and image quality.<lb/></p>

			<head>Comparison with previous studies<lb/></head>

			<p>Unlike previous reports, <ref type="biblio">10</ref> the type of DOAC was not<lb/> an independent risk factor for post-ESD bleeding in this<lb/> study. We speculate that this was due to an insufficient<lb/> number of patients and fewer bleeding events (apixa-<lb/>ban, n = 2; rivaroxaban and edoxaban, n = 1 each). The<lb/> definition of bleeding in this study was based on previ-<lb/>ous reports, <ref type="biblio">14</ref> and although slightly lower, the bleeding<lb/> rate in this study was similar to those in previous reports.<lb/> However, the resection specimen size was a significant<lb/> risk factor for post-ESD bleeding in this study, as in a<lb/> previous study. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> One previous large study <ref type="biblio">13</ref> that also<lb/> developed a predictive model for bleeding after ESD lim-<lb/>ited the cases to those with early gastric cancer, while<lb/> our study included those with early gastric cancer and<lb/> adenoma. Additionally, our study included cases treated<lb/> after the publication of the supplemental guidelines,<lb/> unlike previous studies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Clinical implications<lb/></head>

			<p>Two cases of thromboembolism associated with anti-<lb/>coagulant withdrawal were observed in this study and<lb/> involved warfarin replacement with heparin. The sup-<lb/>plemental guidelines recommend endoscopic treatment<lb/> with continuous warfarin therapy if the prothrombin time-<lb/>international normalized ratio is within the therapeutic<lb/> range or a temporary change to DOAC for non-valvular<lb/> atrial fibrillation. Both cases were noted before the<lb/> publication of the supplemental guidelines. Therefore,<lb/> the supplement recommending short-term withdrawal<lb/> or continuation of antithrombotic agents may prevent<lb/> thromboembolism without increasing the postoperative<lb/> bleeding rate.<lb/> Only five variables were incorporated into the predic-<lb/>tion model because of the number of events in the pre-<lb/>publication group. The following were significant: &quot;two<lb/> or more antithrombotic medications,&quot; &quot;heparin replace-<lb/>ment,&quot; &quot;hemodialysis,&quot; and &quot;specimen size ≥38 mm.&quot;<lb/> All variables are known or expected to contribute to<lb/> postoperative bleeding. &quot;Two or more antithrombotic<lb/> medications,&quot; &quot;heparin replacement,&quot; &quot;hemodialysis,&quot; and<lb/> &quot;large specimen size&quot; are reported risk factors for<lb/> postoperative bleeding. <ref type="biblio">9,10,15,16</ref> Although there are no<lb/> reports of &quot;procedure time&quot; as a risk factor, we included<lb/> it because it is likely to be influenced by a combination<lb/> of the surgeon&apos;s skill, surgical difficulty, and frequency of<lb/> intraoperative bleeding and hemostasis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Regarding the Kaplan-Meier curve, the high-risk<lb/> group was clearly more likely to bleed within 14 days<lb/> after the endoscopic procedure. Therefore, additional<lb/> endoscopic observation should be considered not only<lb/> immediately after but also during the 1-2 weeks after<lb/> the procedure.<lb/></p>

			<head>Limitations and strengths<lb/></head>

			<p>The reduction in the operative time before and after<lb/> the publication of the guidelines suggests that ESD<lb/> techniques may have improved over time, possibly intro-<lb/>ducing bias. Furthermore, this study was limited by<lb/> its single-center, retrospective nature. Compared with<lb/> previous multicenter studies <ref type="biblio">15</ref> that developed predic-<lb/>tion models for post-ESD bleeding, fewer cases were<lb/> included in this study; therefore, only five variables were<lb/> included in the model. However, the performance of the<lb/> model was good, with an AUC of 0.83, better than that in<lb/> previous studies. Even after the publication of the sup-<lb/>plementary guidelines, the model&apos;s accuracy remained<lb/> good, with an AUC of 0.72. Generally, the accuracy of<lb/> risk models declines as the environment changes over<lb/> time. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> The model in this study functioned effectively<lb/> even when the time axis was different and clinical prac-<lb/>tice was supposed to be different due to changes in the<lb/> guidelines, thus indicating its robustness.<lb/></p>

			<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study<lb/> to compare the results of a predictive model for post-<lb/>ESD bleeding before and after the publication of these<lb/> supplementary guidelines. In other words, this study is<lb/> the first to show that a prediction model based on pre-<lb/>publication data can be applied to post-publication data<lb/> and that the AUC for post-publication data can be as<lb/> good as 0.72. Furthermore, this study suggests that the<lb/> BEST-J score of Hatta et al. <ref type="biblio">13</ref> may also be applicable<lb/> to daily practice. We conduct our daily practice in accor-<lb/>dance with the supplemental guidelines and believe that<lb/> this is of sufficient clinical significance. On the other<lb/> hand, the predictive model in this study produced com-<lb/>parable results with fewer variables than the BEST-J<lb/> score. Although this is another strength of this study, it<lb/> is necessary to examine the generalizability and inter-<lb/>institutional differences using multicenter studies in the<lb/> future.<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>There were changes in patient characteristics and clin-<lb/>ical practice regarding ESD after the publication of the<lb/> supplementary guidelines. Nevertheless, we developed<lb/> a predictive model for post-ESD bleeding that main-<lb/>tained accuracy over time. In the future, we would like<lb/> to introduce the developed model into clinical prac-<lb/>tice and conduct interventional studies, such as the<lb/> incorporation of prophylactic hemostasis in high-risk<lb/> patients and active endoscopic observation the day after<lb/> ESD.</p>
