The group was composed of 256 <lb/>males and 3 13 females. Their mean age <lb/>was 32.4 years, and mean duration of sea-<lb/>sonal allergic rhinitis was 14.5 years, with <lb/>mean age of onset of 17.7 years. After re-<lb/>ceiving placebo for 1 week, patients were <lb/>randomly allocated to receive an antihist-<lb/>amine (fexofenadine or loratadine) for 2 <lb/>weeks. Patient preferences for relief of in-<lb/>dividual allergy symptoms (rhinitis; sneez-<lb/>ing; itchy, watery, red eyes; itchy nose, <lb/>palate, or throat) and related conditions <lb/>(fatigue, physical limitations) were scored <lb/>using 2 different questionnaires before <lb/>treatment (O-to-10 category rating scale <lb/>for assessing the 4 symptoms of allergic <lb/>rhinitis) and after receiving placebo for 1 <lb/>week (Feeling Thermometer). Symptom <lb/>severity was reported in patient diaries af-<lb/>ter 1 and 2 weeks of antihistamine treat-<lb/>ment and was measured by patient self-<lb/>assessment. All symptoms were considered <lb/>by the patients to be important to relieve, <lb/>the most important being itchy, watery, <lb/>red eyes and rhinorrhea. The severity of <lb/>allergy symptoms was consistently related <lb/>to the importance of symptoms identified <lb/>before treatment. Therefore, including pa-<lb/>tient preferences in medical evaluations <lb/>might be a useful tool in evaluating the <lb/>success of their treatment. Key words: sea-<lb/>sonal allergic rhinitis, patient preferences, <lb/>fexofenadine, loratadine. <lb/></front>

			<body>N. RICARD <lb/>ET AL. <lb/>tients in decision making about their care <lb/>would improve their perception of health <lb/>care quality. Compliance with treatment <lb/>regimens may be compromised <lb/>if the <lb/>treatment goals of the health care worker <lb/>and the patient do not coincide.&apos; A basic <lb/>assumption of outcomes research that <lb/>measures only quantifiable variables such <lb/>as physical or physiologic factors (eg, <lb/>white blood cell count, blood pressure, or <lb/>serum cholesterol levels) is that such mea-<lb/>sures are important to patients. However, <lb/>patients are primarily concerned with im-<lb/>proving their daily functioning rather than <lb/>with medically defined physiologic func-<lb/>tions whose effects they may not be able <lb/>to discem.2 <lb/>Preference refers to the level of desir-<lb/>ability that a person associates with a par-<lb/>ticular health state, treatment process, du-<lb/>ration of treatment or illness, or level of <lb/>participation. Preference-based scores are <lb/>a useful complement to symptom indices <lb/>or quality-of-life <lb/>scores. Health care <lb/>providers and patients may hold different <lb/>views about which attributes of a health <lb/>state are important. The changing dynam-<lb/>ics of modem health care, combined with <lb/>ethical considerations, have led to an at-<lb/>tempt to understand the foundations of <lb/>patient decision making.3 <lb/>Allergies and allergic symptoms may <lb/>have a substantial impact on an individ-<lb/>ual&apos;s quality of life. The symptoms can <lb/>affect daily activities, including work pro-<lb/>ductivity, learning performance, and in-<lb/>terpersonal relationships.4 Symptoms as-<lb/>sociated with common allergies generally <lb/>are not life threatening. In clinical deci-<lb/>sion making, health care professionals <lb/>must consider to what extent symptoms <lb/>affect each patient. Physicians and pa-<lb/>tients need information regarding the im-<lb/>pact of treatment on the patient&apos;s quality <lb/>of life and performance in the workplace, <lb/>at school, and at home. Patients tend to <lb/>evaluate a medication based not only on <lb/>its clinical effectiveness, but also on how <lb/>it affects all aspects of their lives.2 <lb/>Antihistamines are the most commonly <lb/>used antiallergy medications.5 They act as <lb/>competitive antagonists of histamine at <lb/>the HI-receptor site responsible for stim-<lb/>ulating sensory nerves and increasing vas-<lb/>cular permeability and mucus production. <lb/>Therefore, antihistamine activity dimin-<lb/>ishes pruritus, sneezing, and rhinorrhea.6 <lb/>Patients&apos; commitment to their personal <lb/>health care greatly contributes to compli-<lb/>ance.7 A focus on improving symptoms <lb/>identified as most bothersome by each pa-<lb/>tient more accurately reflects whether the <lb/>patient perceives treatment as successful. <lb/>In this study our objectives were the <lb/>following: <lb/>to identify which specific <lb/>symptoms were perceived by patients to <lb/>be the most important to alleviate (per-<lb/>sonal preferences); to investigate the rela-<lb/>tionship between patient preferences for <lb/>relief of symptoms and the severity of <lb/>symptoms following 2 weeks of treatment <lb/>with antihistamines; and to investigate the <lb/>influence of compliance history with al-<lb/>lergy medication and patient personal <lb/>preferences on alleviation of specific al-<lb/>lergy symptoms. <lb/>The efficacy and safety results of the pres-<lb/>ent study are not the subject of this paper <lb/>and are reported elsewhere (unpublished <lb/>data, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Canada). <lb/>PATIENTS AND METHODS <lb/>Patients <lb/>All patients were 212 years of age and <lb/>had had seasonal allergic rhinitis during <lb/>spring of the 2 previous years. Seasonal <lb/></body>

			<body>allergic rhinitis was defined as im-<lb/>munoglobulin E-modulated immunologic <lb/>response to allergens released during tree, <lb/>grass, or weed pollination, that is charac-<lb/>terized by sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal con-<lb/>gestion, and nasal pruritus.* Participants <lb/>had had a positive epicutaneous response <lb/>to antihistamine; a total reflective score of <lb/>&gt;6 for the previous 12 hours; and 2 or <lb/>more symptoms of seasonal allergic rhini-<lb/>tis rated as moderate or severe, with no <lb/>symptom rated as very severe. <lb/>Pregnant or lactating women, patients <lb/>who had contracted upper respiratory tract <lb/>infections within 30 days preceding the <lb/>start of the study, and patients with sig-<lb/>nificant diseases (ie, malnutrition, blood <lb/>dyscrasia, renal or hepatic insufficiency, <lb/>chronic infection, malignancy malabsorp-<lb/>tion, or any other clinically significant <lb/>cardiovascular, <lb/>hepatic, neurologic, en-<lb/>docrine, or other major systemic disease <lb/>that would make implementation of the <lb/>protocol or interpretation of the results <lb/>difficult), or a history of alcohol or drug <lb/>abuse or hypersensitivity <lb/>to the study <lb/>medications were excluded. <lb/>Study Design <lb/>A multicenter, parallel-group, double-<lb/>masked, randomized design was used for <lb/>this questionnaire-derived <lb/>assessment. <lb/>At study entry (visit I), the total symp-<lb/>toms score (TSS) questionnaire was ad-<lb/>ministered to all patients to assess their <lb/>preferences for relief of specific allergy <lb/>symptoms. At the same time, a symptom-<lb/>severity measure was also administered. <lb/>At visit 1, participants also completed a <lb/>questionnaire describing the history of <lb/>their allergy medication use, listing which <lb/>specific medications they usually took for <lb/>symptom relief and how often. The fol-<lb/>lowing symptoms were assessed: sneez-<lb/>ing; rhinorrhea; itchy nose, palate, or <lb/>throat; and itchy, watery, red eyes. After <lb/>receiving placebo for 1 week (visit 2), a <lb/>second questionnaire on patient prefer-<lb/>ences, distinct from the first one, was ad-<lb/>ministered. The patients were then ran-<lb/>domly allocated to receive 2 weeks of <lb/>either fexofenadine 60 mg twice a day or <lb/>loratadine 10 mg once a day (Figure 1). <lb/>The protocol and the informed consent <lb/>document were approved by each investi-<lb/>gator&apos;s ethics review committee or inde-<lb/>pendent review committee. The study was <lb/>conducted at 20 Canadian clinical sites. <lb/>Each patient was required to sign a writ-<lb/>ten informed consent form that explained <lb/>the purpose of the study, the risks and <lb/>benefits of participation, and provided as-<lb/>surance of confidentiality. <lb/>Outcome Measures <lb/>Efficacy, which was not the objective of <lb/>the present study, was determined on a daily <lb/>basis using the TSS-a sum of the individ-<lb/>ual scores on the patient-reported symptom <lb/>severity scale (0 to 4 points, with 4 being <lb/>the most severe) for each of 4 symptoms: <lb/>sneezing; rhinorrhea; itchy nose, palate, or <lb/>throat; and itchy, watery, red eyes. <lb/>Personal Preference <lb/>Personal preference was defined as the <lb/>importance to each patient of relieving <lb/>each allergy symptom (ie, most important <lb/>to relieve or not most important to re-<lb/>lieve). A MEDLINE@ <lb/>search failed to <lb/>identify an existing, appropriate, well-<lb/>validated instrument to address our objec-<lb/>tives; we therefore developed instruments <lb/>specifically for our study. <lb/>A visual analog scale was selected for <lb/>its simplicity in measuring subjective phe-<lb/>nomena. The scale has been studied ex-<lb/>tensively and has been shown to be reli-<lb/></body>

In the patient-preference assessment, <lb/>patients are asked to rate the importance <lb/>of relieving each allergy symptom and re-<lb/>lated condition on a scale (0 = relief is not <lb/>important at all; 10 = relief is very im-<lb/>portant). The Feeling Thermometer indi-<lb/>cates the degree to which patients are <lb/>bothered by allergy symptoms (0 = least <lb/>bothersome; 10 = most bothersome). <lb/>Efficacy was determined daily using <lb/>the patient-rated TSS. Both the efficacy <lb/>(symptom severity) and the preference <lb/>measurements evaluated the same 4 symp-<lb/>toms: sneezing; rhinorrhea; itchy nose, <lb/>palate, or throat; and itchy, watery, red <lb/>eyes. Two allergy-related conditions (fa-<lb/>tigue and physical limitations) were also <lb/>assessed. Therefore, the face and content <lb/>validity, indicating that the instruments <lb/>were assessing the desired qualities, were <lb/>met in our opinion. <lb/>Instruments were not administered a <lb/>second time to determine reliability. Bas-<lb/>ing the reliability of the instruments on <lb/>a single administration and the calcula-<lb/>tion of the Cronbach&apos;s alpha was not an <lb/>optimal approach because we did not as-<lb/>sume from the start that each score <lb/>would correlate with other scores. On <lb/>the contrary, we expected preference <lb/>scores to be quite different from one an-<lb/>other. The results, however, were con-<lb/>trary to our expectations. <lb/>At recruitment, the questionnaire was <lb/>used to assess patient preferences: pa-<lb/>tients were requested to indicate the im-<lb/>portance of relieving 4 allergy symptoms, <lb/>forming the basis of the TSS, and 2 al-<lb/>lergy-related conditions, using a O-to-10 <lb/>category rating scale. After receiving <lb/>placebo for 1 week (visit 2), the prefer-<lb/>ence scores for symptom relief were also <lb/>assessed using the Feeling Thermometer. <lb/>These scores were compared with <lb/>scores obtained using the previous cate-<lb/>gory rating scale. Because the Feeling <lb/>Thermometer questionnaire was admin-<lb/></body>

			<body>istered after receiving placebo for 1 <lb/>week, it was assumed that the derived <lb/>preference scaling factors might reflect <lb/>the true attributed value without refer-<lb/>ence to a specific medication. For each <lb/>symptom and condition, the mean and <lb/>median of the category rating scores from <lb/>the rating scale were calculated. To de-<lb/>fine the influence of previous medication <lb/>on preference baseline assessment, the <lb/>mean scores were also estimated for pa-<lb/>tients on the basis of medication used in <lb/>the past year. Moreover, patient prefer-<lb/>ences were estimated by compliance <lb/>group and by sex. Patients&apos; customary <lb/>dosages and frequency were also in-<lb/>cluded. The correlation among symptoms <lb/>was then assessed. <lb/>Personal Preferences and Allergy <lb/>Symptom Scores <lb/>Following treatment with 1 of the ac-<lb/>tive medications (fexofenadine 60 mg <lb/>twice a day or loratadine 10 mg once a <lb/>day), patients were classified according to <lb/>the specific symptom they identified as <lb/>most important to relieve in the baseline <lb/>category rating (most important or not <lb/>most important), regardless of treatment <lb/>group. <lb/>Symptom severity scores were available <lb/>from patient diary entries during treatment. <lb/>Patients indicated the severity of each <lb/>symptom on a scale of 0 to 4 points, with <lb/>4 being the most severe. For each symp-<lb/>tom, mean symptom scores were calcu-<lb/>lated and correlated to the level of impor-<lb/>tance (most important or not most <lb/>important to relieve) indicated at baseline. <lb/>Statistical Analysis <lb/>The distribution of the symptoms rated <lb/>as the most important to be relieved in the <lb/>2 study treatment groups was checked in <lb/>contingency tables to assure comparabil-<lb/>ity of groups. Correlation coefficients <lb/>(Spearman&apos;s rank-order coefficient, rho) <lb/>among symptoms for category rating <lb/>scores were estimated to assess the rela-<lb/>tionship between the patients&apos; personal <lb/>preferences and the severity of symptoms. <lb/>Because TSS is the calculation of a mean <lb/>from ordinal values, parametric statistical <lb/>analyses were deemed appropriate, partic-<lb/>ularly since the distribution of this vari-<lb/>able was normal. Parametric tests are con-<lb/>sidered to be acceptable for evaluating <lb/>visual analog scales.9 <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>The study population consisted of 256 <lb/>males and 3 13 females with a mean age <lb/>of 32.4 years and a mean body mass in-<lb/>dex of 25.4; mean duration of seasonal al-<lb/>lergic rhinitis was 14.5 years, with a mean <lb/>age at onset of 17.7 years. <lb/>Upon recruitment, patients completed <lb/>the category rating scale questionnaire, in-<lb/>dicating which symptoms they would like <lb/>to relieve. Following the 7-day placebo <lb/>period, 491 patients completed the Feeling <lb/>Thermometer questionnaire dealing with <lb/>their preferences. The 73 patients who did <lb/>not complete the Feeling Thermometer <lb/>questionnaire were excluded from the clin-<lb/>ical study and, therefore, could not be as-<lb/>sessed using this measurement. <lb/>Symptom Preference <lb/>All allergy symptoms were rated as im-<lb/>portant to relieve (mean 26.

On a O-to-10 rating scale, <lb/>the participants attributed a value of &gt;6 <lb/>(interquartile range containing 50% of ob-<lb/>servations), primarily between 7 and 9, to <lb/>each symptom.

Fatigue and physical limitations <lb/>were relatively less important (mean <lb/>scores 7.0 and 6.5, respectively). <lb/>Preference measurements completed at <lb/>the end of the placebo period using the <lb/>Feeling Thermometer indicated that, over-<lb/>all, the mean scores were slightly lower <lb/>than those obtained using the O-to-10 cate-<lb/>gory rating scale prior to the study; how-<lb/>ever, results were similar in that patients <lb/>indicated that rhinorrhea and itchy, watery, <lb/>red eyes were the most important symp-<lb/>toms to relieve. The results obtained prior <lb/>to treatment and after receiving placebo <lb/>for 1 week are summarized in Table I. No <lb/>statistically significant differences were ob-<lb/>served between the 2 observations for any <lb/>of the parameters evaluated. <lb/>The association between symptoms in-<lb/>dicated that all correlation coefficients were <lb/>significant at the P &lt; 0.01 level; however, <lb/>the correlations were weak. The 2 highest <lb/>correlations were those between sneezing <lb/>and rhinorrhea (0.52), and between fatigue <lb/>and physical limitations (0.55) (Table II). <lb/>Overall, women assigned higher scores <lb/>to relief of allergy symptoms than men <lb/>(P &lt; 0.001 for itchy nose, palate, or throat; <lb/>P &lt; 0.05 for fatigue). Patients who were <lb/>compliant with previous treatments as-<lb/>signed lower severity scores (P &lt; 0.05 for <lb/>rhinorrhea and physical limitations). No <lb/>significant differences were observed be-<lb/>tween the 2 treatment groups. <lb/>Although patients in the 2 treatment <lb/>groups received their respective medications <lb/>(fexofenadine or loratadine) under identical <lb/>clinical trial conditions, scoring of allergy <lb/>symptoms during the treatment period was <lb/>consistently linked to the importance of <lb/>symptoms identified prior to treatment. Dif-<lb/>ferences in efficacy scores between most <lb/>important (1) and not most important (2 to <lb/>4) were statistically significant for itchy <lb/>nose, palate, or throat; itchy, watery, red <lb/>eyes; and rhinorrhea (P &lt; 0.01) (Table III). <lb/>The distribution of patients by personal <lb/>preference was equivalent in the 2 treat-<lb/>ment groups. <lb/>When patients were stratified according <lb/>to the medications they had been taking <lb/>prior to the study (none, Claritin@ [Scher-<lb/></body>

Because patient preferences were <lb/>equally distributed in the 2 treatment <lb/>groups, this variable did not introduce any <lb/>bias for the eftlcacy results. <lb/></body>

			<page>274 <lb/></page>

			<body>The mean preference scores on the Feel-<lb/>ing Thermometer (after receiving placebo <lb/>for 1 week) were slightly lower than those <lb/>obtained at baseline on a O-to-10 category <lb/>rating scale, although the patterns of re-<lb/>sponse were similar. However, because the <lb/>values were obtained from 2 different in-<lb/>struments administered at 2 different time <lb/>periods, they were not directly comparable. <lb/>Any previous medication, whether used <lb/>correctly or incorrectly (underused or <lb/>overused), could have introduced a bias <lb/>when preference baseline values were <lb/>measured.5 <lb/>Compliant patients assigned lower pref-<lb/>erence scores than noncompliant patients. <lb/>The degree of patient compliance was de-<lb/>termined by comparing the pattern of med-<lb/>ication utilization, as reported in a product <lb/>utilization questionnaire, to the recom-<lb/>mended regimens.5 Many factors could <lb/>explain this relationship. It is assumed <lb/>that because compliant patients take al-<lb/>lergy medications at the appropriate <lb/>dosage, they are less likely to experience <lb/>allergies.5 Thus they would be expected <lb/>to rate their symptoms as having less im-<lb/>portance. Conversely, because noncom-<lb/>pliant patients are less likely to receive <lb/>correct doses, their allergy symptoms tend <lb/></body>

Therefore, they may at-<lb/>tribute a higher importance to their symp-<lb/>toms. It would then be expected that if a <lb/>patient&apos;s allergies are not relieved, the pa-<lb/>tient would be dissatisfied and would tend <lb/>to be less compliant.&quot; <lb/>One of the limitations of the study was <lb/>that the reliability measure of the instru-<lb/>ments was not assessed by administering <lb/>the questionnaires a second time to the <lb/>same population. Basing the reliability of <lb/>the instruments on a single administration <lb/>and the calculation of Cronbach&apos;s alpha <lb/>was not an optimal approach because it <lb/>was not assumed from the start that each <lb/>score would correlate with other scores. <lb/>On the contrary, we expected the prefer-<lb/>ence scores to be quite different from one <lb/>another, but this was not the case. No other <lb/>reliability test was conducted. <lb/>Knowing which symptom a patient <lb/>wants to relieve the most can help to pre-<lb/>dict the level of satisfaction with a treat-<lb/>ment.1,7,12 Clinicians committed to im-<lb/>proving patient outcomes must recognize <lb/>outcomes that are valued by patients and <lb/>that shape their motivation to comply. Un-<lb/>derstanding the patient&apos;s perspective re-<lb/>quires that the patient be an active partic-<lb/>ipant in the research.2 Patients&apos; self-rating <lb/>of treatment effects should always be in-<lb/>cluded when evaluating a treatment. Tech-<lb/>niques for surveying patients about their <lb/>preferences for health outcomes have been <lb/>applied primarily in research settings, hav-<lb/>ing only recently been introduced in clin-<lb/>ical practice. &apos; <lb/>Patients who are integral partners in <lb/>making medical decisions are more satis-<lb/>fied with their care, more adherent to rec-<lb/>ommendations, and experience better <lb/>health outcomes.&apos; It has been demon-<lb/>strated that patient satisfaction can influ-<lb/>ence the efficacy of interventions, as well <lb/>as adherence behavior such as compliance <lb/>and care-seeking,2,13-15 and should be in-<lb/>cluded as a measure of the quality of <lb/>health care.r6 Shared decision making <lb/>may lead to increased satisfaction with <lb/>the decision and consequently to better <lb/>compliance and better health outcomes.&quot; <lb/>Based on the observations from this ques-<lb/>tionnaire-derived survey, the sequence of <lb/>events shown in Figure 2 is proposed. <lb/>Few validated instruments for the mea-<lb/>surement of satisfaction are currently <lb/>available.
