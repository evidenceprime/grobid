	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Objectives: In July 2017, supplementary guidelines on anticoagulants,<lb/> including direct oral anticoagulants, were published in Japan. We investigated<lb/> the changes in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of gastric mucosal<lb/> lesions after the publication of the supplement, examined the risk factors, and<lb/> developed a predictive model for post-ESD bleeding.<lb/> Methods: We included 2272 gastric ESD cases from our hospital between<lb/> May 2003 and June 2021 and classified them into two groups: 1789 cases<lb/> before and 483 after the publication of the supplementary guidelines. A pre-<lb/>dictive model for post-ESD bleeding was developed using the pre-publication<lb/> cohort data.<lb/> Results: The proportion of patients receiving warfarin decreased (5.0% vs.<lb/> 1.4%) and those receiving direct oral anticoagulants increased (1.2% vs.<lb/> 6.8%) after the publication of the supplementary guidelines. Post-ESD bleed-<lb/>ing occurred in 61 patients, but there was no significant difference in the<lb/> bleeding rate between the groups (50 [2.8%] vs. 11 [2.3%] patients, respec-<lb/>tively). Five risk factors (number of antithrombotic agents, dialysis, heparin<lb/> replacement, resection specimen size, and procedure time) were identified<lb/> for model development. The C-statistic for the model and post-publication<lb/> cohorts were 0.83 and 0.72, respectively. In the model, each risk factor for<lb/> postoperative bleeding was scored, and the risk was classified into three lev-<lb/>els according to the total score. Bleeding rates at low, intermediate, and high<lb/> risks were 1.6%, 10.3%, and 38.9%, respectively.<lb/> Conclusion: Despite changes in patient characteristics and clinical prac-<lb/>tice regarding ESD before and after the publication of the supplementary<lb/> guidelines, we could still develop a simple and useful predictive model.<lb/></div>
