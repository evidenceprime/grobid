			<p>The increasing prevalence of allergic respiratory diseases is<lb/> well documented <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref>. Allergic rhinitis has the highest<lb/> prevalence <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>, affecting an average of 24% of the European<lb/> population <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. Eighty percent of asthma patients and 80%<lb/> of children with atopic dermatitis <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref> suffer from allergic<lb/> rhinitis. Clinical trials have documented the severity of<lb/> allergic rhinitis and its impact on quality of life <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. A<lb/> new classification of allergic rhinitis was proposed in the<lb/> Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guide-<lb/>lines based on severity and duration rather than causality<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. Complications of allergic rhinitis and concomitant<lb/> diseases are well documented, such as acute and chronic<lb/> sinusitis, recurrence of nasal polyps, otitis media/otitis<lb/> media with effusion, hearing impairment, abnormal cra-<lb/>niofacial development, sleep apnea, aggravation of under-<lb/>lying asthma, and increased propensity to develop asthma<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[7 ]</ref>. Daytime fatigue, learning impairment, decreased<lb/> overall cognitive functioning, and decreased long-term<lb/> productivityhave alsobeen attributedto allergicrhinitis<ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Allergic rhinitis, especially persistent allergic rhinitis<lb/> (PER), is a serious debilitating disease. However, there<lb/> is still doubt among regulatory agencies and health payers<lb/> about how serious allergic rhinitis is. The use of over-the-<lb/>counter drugs is common in allergy sufferers <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>. As costs<lb/> are shifted away from insurers to patients, the risk of<lb/> denying patients, access to effective, comprehensive, and<lb/> physician-supervised disease management is growing.<lb/></p>

			<p>Patient involvement in the management of allergic rhi-<lb/>nitis is important. Knowledge of patients&apos; perceptions of<lb/> their disease and its consequences are scarce; so, we<lb/> evaluated the impact of allergic rhinitis on the lives of<lb/> allergy sufferers and assessed the success of its manage-<lb/>ment. Aware that many sufferers of allergic rhinitis are<lb/> undiagnosed and unaware of their disease <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>, we chose to<lb/> survey self-reported allergic rhinitis patients who are<lb/> members of European allergy patient organizations<lb/> (www.efanet.org). Thus, our survey reflects the know-<lb/>ledge and experience of motivated and self-conscious<lb/> allergy sufferers.<lb/></p>

			<p>The questionnaire we chose to use is patient-oriented<lb/> and descriptive. There are studies and surveys using<lb/> various validated health-related quality-of-life and<lb/> patient-perspectives questionnaires. Most of them report<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/></head>

			<p>The Patient Voice Allergy Survey was a quantitative, self-<lb/>completion survey, initiated, co-ordinated, supervised<lb/> and conducted by the European Federation of Allergy<lb/> and Airways Diseases Patients&apos; Associations (EFA) in<lb/> Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany,<lb/> Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and<lb/> the UK. A total of 3562 questionnaires were collected<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The following key areas were covered: (1)<lb/> background information on allergic rhinitis, (2) severity of<lb/> symptoms and their impact, (3) nonmedical measures, (4)<lb/> medication, and (5) concomitant conditions. A descrip-<lb/>tion of the questions appears in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. The original<lb/> questionnaire was designed in English and was translated<lb/> in the local languages through professional interpreters.<lb/></p>

			<p>The local patient organizations sent the questionnaire to<lb/> their members with a cover letter clarifying the purpose<lb/> of the survey and an explanation of how the results would<lb/> be used. The completed questionnaires were sent to a<lb/> central market-research agency (Aequus Research,<lb/> London, UK), which compiled a descriptive report.<lb/> The report was planned to be presented both as individ-<lb/>ual results by country and as consolidated pan-European<lb/> results. The latter only are presented in this paper.<lb/></p>

			<head>Primary objectives<lb/></head>

			<p>The aim of the this survey was to explore the impact of<lb/> allergic rhinitis on the lives of sufferers across Europe. The<lb/> primary objectives were to answer the following questions:<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(1)</ref> what is the nature of allergic rhinitis and the signifi-<lb/>cance on daily life, (2) which aspects of life does allergic<lb/> rhinitis affect, <ref type="biblio">(3)</ref> what is the prevalence of concomitant<lb/> allergic diseases, and (<ref type="formula">4</ref>) what are the costs for preventive<lb/> measures and medications and are they effective?<lb/></p>

			<p>In the pan-European analysis results were weighted to<lb/> account for the returned questionnaires not being in the<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>

			<p>We collected and analysed 3562 questionnaires. Weighted<lb/> results accounting for differences between countries,<lb/> allergic rhinitis populations and responses achieved<lb/> are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Background and severity of symptoms<lb/></head>

			<p>Allergic rhinitis is a long-term -in 25% of patients a<lb/> lifelong -condition (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). More than 50% of patients<lb/> have suffered from allergic rhinitis for 11 years or more.<lb/> Almost 50% of patients experience allergic rhinitis symp-<lb/>toms for two seasons of the year or more (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Per-<lb/>sistent allergic rhinitis (PER), defined as rhinitis of which<lb/> symptoms last for ! 4 days/week and ! 4 weeks/year, was<lb/> reported by 62%. More female patients reported PER<lb/> (66%) than male (55%). Allergic rhinitis is triggered by a<lb/> range of allergens (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Patients rated the severity of nine allergic rhinitis symp-<lb/>toms (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Sixty-six percent experienced at least one<lb/> symptom severe enough to interfere with their daily<lb/> activities or sleep; 40% of those experienced at least<lb/> three severe symptoms; and 57% of the patients with<lb/> intermittent allergic rhinitis (IAR) reported at least one<lb/> severe symptom, the number for PER being 72%. PER<lb/> patients suffer significantly more than the IAR patients<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The impact on sleep is a major consideration for allergy<lb/> patients. Forty-six percent of patients do not feel rested<lb/></p>

			<head>Impact of symptoms on patients&apos; lives<lb/></head>

			<p>Eighty-seven percent of the PER and 79% of the IAR<lb/> patients feel that their rhinitis symptoms affected moder-<lb/>ately to severely at least one daily activity &apos;all the time&apos;<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The impact of allergic rhinitis is most severe on<lb/> work, school, outdoor activities and sleep. Forty-nine<lb/> percent of the working patients (n ¼ 2287) report their<lb/> work affected by allergic rhinitis and 41% of patients<lb/> reported affected sleep. A considerable proportion of<lb/> patients also reported an affected social life (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The average proportion of the working patients<lb/> (n ¼ 2287) taking time off work in the past year due to<lb/> their allergic rhinitis symptoms was 26%, and taking time<lb/> off school (n ¼ 376) was higher: 38%. Allergic rhinitis has<lb/> a moderate to severe emotional impact in 77% of PER<lb/> and in 66% of IAR patients (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The most bothersome symptoms for all patients with<lb/> allergic rhinitis are runny nose (22%), sneezing (14%),<lb/> blocked nose (12%), emotional toll (11%), tiredness<lb/> (11%), affected daily activities (10%) and difficulty<lb/> breathing (10%). The most bothersome symptoms of<lb/> PER and IAR were largely similar, with the exception<lb/> of runny nose (24% for PER, 18% for IAR), tiredness<lb/> (12% for PER, 8% for IAR), outdoor activities (12% for<lb/> PER, 5% for IAR), itchy eyes (11% for PER, 6% for IAR),<lb/> affected daily activities (8% for PER, 13% for IAR) and<lb/> difficulty breathing (8% for PER, 12% for IAR).<lb/></p>

			<p>Nonmedical measures taken to ease symptoms<lb/> Sixty-three percent of allergic rhinitis sufferers have<lb/> made changes to their homes to ease symptoms. The<lb/> most common measures are buying a humidifier/air clean-<lb/>er (31%), replacing furniture (30%), getting rid of soft<lb/> furnishings (29%). Eight percent of sufferers stopped<lb/></p>

			<p>smoking indoors, 7% removed carpets, and 7% bought<lb/> special hygiene products. Only 3% bought special<lb/> bedding and 2% used pollen screens. The costs for<lb/> these household measures are considerable, with 22%<lb/> of patients spending more than s350 a year and another<lb/> 24% spending between s100 and s350 a year.<lb/></p>

			<p>Allergic rhinitis sufferers were not happy with the effect-<lb/>iveness of the household changes (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). The use of<lb/> special bedding was moderately effective, but only in<lb/> those with confirmed mite allergy (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Allergic rhinitis patients visit doctors on average three<lb/> times a year. PER patients visit their doctors 3.</p>

			<figure type="table">5 times a<lb/> year compared with 2.4 times for IAR patients. Almost<lb/> half of the diagnoses are made by GPs (48%), and 32%<lb/> by allergy and ear, nose and throat specialists. A high<lb/> proportion of allergic rhinitis patients take medications<lb/> to either prevent (77%) or control (88%) their symp-<lb/>toms. Antihistamines are the most widely used. For the<lb/> control of rhinitis symptoms, 18% of patients use anti-<lb/>histamines alone, 11% used them in combination with<lb/> nasal steroids and 11% use antihistamines together<lb/> with nasal steroids and eye drops. Only 5% of patients<lb/> use nasal steroids alone.<lb/> Medication use is higher among PER patients compared<lb/> to those with IAR.

			<p>The remaining 12% of antihistamines are used for pre-<lb/>vention. Patients report antihistamines as their major<lb/> medication followed by nasal steroids and eye drops<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). The drugs are mostly obtained via prescriptions,<lb/> but some patients buy their antihistamines (25%), nasal<lb/> steroid sprays (17%) and eye drops (22%) without a<lb/> prescription (Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).<lb/></p>

Only 4, 5 and 6% of patients report that<lb/> the current medications are not effective at all for,<lb/> respectively, runny nose, sneezing and blocked nose.<lb/></p>

			<head>Allergic rhinitis and concomitant conditions<lb/></head>

			<p>Asthma, eczema, food allergy and urticaria are concomitant<lb/> diseases for, respectively, 43, 32, 29 and 19% of allergic<lb/> rhinitis patients; in contrast, 37% of patients reported no<lb/> concomitant diseases. Generally, more patients among the<lb/> older respondents (over 65 years of age) report suffering<lb/> from concomitant diseases (especially asthma and food<lb/> allergy) as compared with other age groups. Seventy per-<lb/>cent of patients having asthma believe that their allergic<lb/> rhinitis worsens it. The proportion of patients perceiving<lb/> their allergic rhinitis as having a negative impact on their<lb/> concomitant diseases is not so elevated, though significant,<lb/> with 42, 40 and 37% of patients reporting allergic rhinitis to<lb/> negatively affect their food allergy, eczema and urticaria,<lb/> respectively. Almost all patients (94%) have discussed<lb/> their concomitant asthma with a doctor, whereas the<lb/> proportion for eczema, food allergy and urticaria is, respect-<lb/>ively, 76, 74 and 64%.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>To our knowledge, this is the first survey conducted in a<lb/> selected patient population with allergic rhinitis. These<lb/> are patients who are members of an allergy patient<lb/> organization. The survey addressed patient perceptions<lb/> of the impact that allergic rhinitis has on their lives and on<lb/> treatment practices.<lb/></p>

			<p>Plants/flowers, house dust mites and animals were<lb/> reported as one of the most frequent causes of allergic<lb/> rhinitis symptoms. Tobacco smoke was the fourth big-<lb/>gest trigger. Although a recent study <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref> could not<lb/> establish a significant relationship between exposure<lb/> to tobacco smoke and the increase in allergic sensitiz-<lb/>ation and allergic rhinitis in adults; in our study, every<lb/> third patient perceived tobacco smoke as a cause of<lb/> suffering, in addition to moulds, perfumes, feathers<lb/> and foods.<lb/></p>

			<p>The prevalence of the seasonal allergic symptoms in our<lb/> patients is only 50%, whereas the other half suffers<lb/> during two or more seasons. This is in agreement with<lb/> another European survey reporting 49% of allergic<lb/> rhinitis patients having an established seasonal allergic<lb/> rhinitis <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. Although no big differences were observed<lb/> between the triggers for the two types of rhinitis, there<lb/> was a trend of more triggers being identified by PER<lb/> patients. Although this could be an indication of a<lb/> higher multiseasonality for PER, many perennial trig-<lb/>gers were also perceived as being responsible for<lb/> IAR symptoms.<lb/></p>

			<p>In terms of impact on sleep, PER was clearly the<lb/> more disturbing. Half of the patients suffering from<lb/> PER said they did not feel rested upon waking and that<lb/> their sleep was disturbed. This is important to note<lb/> since there is still a lack of sufficient of understanding<lb/> of how much tiredness and somnolence is caused by<lb/> the antiallergic treatment and how much it is due<lb/> to the disease itself. More differences between the<lb/> two types of rhinitis surfaced when patients had to<lb/> report their daily activities. The adverse impact of<lb/> PER on work, going out, visiting friends, and choosing<lb/> holiday destinations was more pronounced than the<lb/> impact of IAR. Almost half of the patients perceive<lb/> that their rhinitis makes them tired, worn out, irritable<lb/> and frustrated.<lb/></p>

			<p>None of the 169 patients who removed their carpets<lb/> reported any beneficial impact on their rhinitis. More<lb/> than 70% of the 101 patients who bought special<lb/> bedding covers considered them as being not effective.<lb/> Replacement of furniture or the disposal of soft furnish-<lb/>ings, as well as buying humidifiers or air cleaners, was<lb/> equally ineffective or mildly effective. This is in confirm-<lb/>ation with other studies where despite significant<lb/> reductions of house-dust-mite load, no or little evidence<lb/></p>

			<p>All of the above findings question the appropriateness of<lb/> preventive household measures. Eventual household<lb/> changes should be part of the overall disease-manage-<lb/>ment plan discussed with healthcare professionals. These<lb/> findings thus highlight the need for a regular rapport<lb/> between patients and their treating physicians, for<lb/> improved patient education and for accessibility to<lb/> reliable information on effectiveness of household<lb/> measures.<lb/></p>

			<p>The currently utilized medications for allergic rhinitis<lb/> are generally perceived as effective in relieving rhinitis<lb/> symptoms. The purpose of our survey was not to<lb/> distinguish between the efficacies of the various<lb/> pharmacological groups but rather to evaluate the over-<lb/>all satisfaction with the current treatment standards.<lb/> Whereas 20% of patients perceived their current treat-<lb/>ment as highly effective, a similar proportion of patients<lb/> were not satisfied with their treatment. A tendency of<lb/> better satisfaction was noted for drug efficacy on nasal<lb/> symptoms as compared with ocular symptoms. A reason<lb/> for this could be that nasal symptoms are generally<lb/> considered more bothersome and therefore their relief<lb/> leads to higher satisfaction. In addition, oral antihista-<lb/>mines and nasal corticosteroids, whose efficacy on nasal<lb/> symptoms is well documented, are the most frequently<lb/> used medications by our patients. Although the use of<lb/> the new nonsedating antihistamines and nasal steroids<lb/> has significantly improved management of allergic rhi-<lb/>nitis in the last decade, there is still some dissatisfaction<lb/> with the treatment results. This could be partially due<lb/> to noncompliance with the recommended treatment,<lb/> and to the nonprescribed, self-management of patients.<lb/> Another reason could be that patients do not always<lb/> have access to the most potent and efficacious of the<lb/> current treatments.<lb/></p>

			<p>The relationship between rhinitis and asthma is complex<lb/> and has been the topic of interest of many scientific<lb/> publications <ref type="biblio">[16 ]</ref>. Our survey, however, reveals that<lb/> this topic has come out of the academic world and is<lb/> understood and perceived as a real health problem for<lb/> most of the patients. Nearly all of the surveyed patients<lb/> with concomitant asthma have discussed it with their<lb/> doctors. Similarly, 75% of patients with other concomi-<lb/>tant diseases have talked to their physicians about them.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>Allergy patients in 11 European countries have voiced<lb/> their experiences of a disease which is not always seen as<lb/> serious enough to warrant attention from policy-makers,<lb/> prescription medications, doctor&apos;s visits, and follow-up or<lb/> patient education. Patients with allergic rhinitis revealed<lb/> the emotional burden and restrictions to daily life. They<lb/> shared satisfaction for the current treatment options, and<lb/> dissatisfaction for most of the preventive measures.<lb/> While being satisfied with medical treatment, patients<lb/> suffer a significant impact in daily life. The results of this<lb/> survey should be taken into account in future guidelines<lb/> on allergic rhinitis, and should promote relief of the<lb/> emotional burden of allergic rhinitis, stimulate patient<lb/> education, encourage relationship between allergic rhi-<lb/>nitis patients and healthcare professionals, and urge<lb/> governments to abolish preventable triggers in public<lb/> places, schools and work places.</p>
