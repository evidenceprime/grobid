	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Allergies in Latin America is the first cross-national survey that describes the symptoms, impact, and treatment of nasal allergies<lb/> (NAs) in individuals Ն4 years old in Latin America (LA). In total, 22,012 households across the Latin American countries of<lb/> Argentina,</div>

	<address>Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru,</address>

	<div type="abstract">and Venezuela were screened for children, adolescents, and adults with<lb/> a diagnosis of NA and either symptoms or treatment in the past 12 months. A total of 1088 adults and 457 children and adolescents<lb/> were included and the sample was probability based to ensure valid statistical inference to the population. Approximately 7% of the<lb/> LA population was diagnosed with NAs with two of three respondents stating that their allergies were seasonal or intermittent in<lb/> nature. A general practice physician or otolaryngologist diagnosed the majority of individuals surveyed. Nasal congestion was the<lb/> most common and bothersome symptom of NAs. Sufferers indicated that their symptoms affected productivity and sleep and had a<lb/> negative impact on quality of life. Two-thirds of patients reported taking some type of medication for their NAs, with a roughly equal<lb/> percentage of patients reporting taking over-the-counter versus prescription medications. Changing medications was most commonly<lb/> done in those reporting inadequate efficacy. The most common reasons cited for dissatisfaction with current medications were related<lb/> to inadequate effectiveness, effectiveness wearing off with chronic use, failure to provide 24-hour relief, and bothersome side effects<lb/> (e.g., unpleasant taste and retrograde drainage into the esophagus). Findings from this cross-national survey on NAs have confirmed<lb/> a high prevalence of physician-diagnosed NAs and a considerable negative impact on daily quality of life and work productivity as<lb/> well as substantial disease management challenges in LA. Through identification of disease impact on the LA population and further<lb/> defining treatment gaps, clinicians in LA may better understand and treat NAs, thus leading to improvements in overall patient<lb/> satisfaction and quality of life.<lb/></div>

	<div type="abstract">A llergic rhinitis (AR), a chronic inflammatory dis-<lb/>ease of the upper airways, is characterized by<lb/> nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal obstruc-<lb/>tion. 1 AR is considered to be one of the most prevalent<lb/> chronic conditions affecting children and adults and its<lb/> prevalence continues to increase worldwide. However,<lb/> the prevalence appears to be increasing at a higher rate<lb/> in Latin America (LA) compared with other regions<lb/> according to the comparison between Phase I and<lb/> Phase III of the International Study of Asthma and<lb/> Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) survey. 2,3<lb/> AR, considered a nuisance by many, has been stud-<lb/>ied with great exuberance over the past years to ascer-<lb/>tain the true burden of disease. Recent studies have<lb/> shown that AR is associated with increases in school<lb/> and work absenteeism and presenteeism (reduced pro-<lb/>ductivity at work). 4,5 Additionally, it has been shown<lb/> to impair health-related quality of life and impose a<lb/> considerable economic burden on the health care sys-<lb/>tem. 6 -9 Furthermore, studies have shown that subjects<lb/> with poorly controlled AR can also suffer from sleep<lb/> disturbances, chronic fatigue, learning impairment, de-<lb/>creased energy, anxiety, and diminished social interac-<lb/>tion. 5,6,10,11<lb/> To effectively manage AR and associated quality of life<lb/> sequela, AR often requires the chronic use of medications<lb/> From the</div>
