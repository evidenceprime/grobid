Abstract 
Objectives: In July 2017, supplementary guidelines on anticoagulants, 
including direct oral anticoagulants, were published in Japan. We investigated 
the changes in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of gastric mucosal 
lesions after the publication of the supplement, examined the risk factors, and 
developed a predictive model for post-ESD bleeding. 
Methods: We included 2272 gastric ESD cases from our hospital between 
May 2003 and June 2021 and classified them into two groups: 1789 cases 
before and 483 after the publication of the supplementary guidelines. A pre-
dictive model for post-ESD bleeding was developed using the pre-publication 
cohort data. 
Results: The proportion of patients receiving warfarin decreased (5.0% vs. 
1.4%) and those receiving direct oral anticoagulants increased (1.2% vs. 
6.8%) after the publication of the supplementary guidelines. Post-ESD bleed-
ing occurred in 61 patients, but there was no significant difference in the 
bleeding rate between the groups (50 [2.8%] vs. 11 [2.3%] patients, respec-
tively). Five risk factors (number of antithrombotic agents, dialysis, heparin 
replacement, resection specimen size, and procedure time) were identified 
for model development. The C-statistic for the model and post-publication 
cohorts were 0.83 and 0.72, respectively. In the model, each risk factor for 
postoperative bleeding was scored, and the risk was classified into three lev-
els according to the total score. Bleeding rates at low, intermediate, and high 
risks were 1.6%, 10.3%, and 38.9%, respectively. 
Conclusion: Despite changes in patient characteristics and clinical prac-
tice regarding ESD before and after the publication of the supplementary 
guidelines, we could still develop a simple and useful predictive model.

anticoagulants (DOACs), aspirin, and P2Y12 receptor 
antagonists. 9,10 In 2012, the Japan Gastroenterologi-
cal Endoscopy Society published the "Guidelines for 
gastroenterological endoscopy in patients undergoing 
antithrombotic treatment." 11 In July 2017, it published 
a supplement 12 specifying that DOACs should only be 
discontinued briefly when performing endoscopic pro-
cedures with a high risk for bleeding. Due to calls to 
verify the validity of these guidelines, we examined 
changes in ESD for gastric tumors after the publication 
of the supplement in a local community hospital.We also 
examined the risk factors for post-ESD bleeding and 
developed a predictive model. Although predictive mod-
els have been constructed in previous studies, these 
may have been affected by external factors, such as 
changes in the guidelines. Therefore, we aimed to con-
struct a predictive model and clarify the status of gastric 
ESD at our local community hospital before and after the 
publication of the supplementary guidelines to examine 
the risk factors for bleeding after gastric ESD. 

METHODS 

Study design 

This was a retrospective study of gastric ESD cases 
registered in our hospital database. The authors con-
ducted this study in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki and obtained approval from the hospital's eth-
ical review committee. Informed consent was obtained 
from all patients and their families. 

Description of setting 

As a core hospital in our region, we targeted local res-
idents for ESD without distinction. Approximately 100-
150 gastric ESDs per year were performed by multiple 
gastroenterologists; proficiency varied from trainees to 
experts. Approximately 20 physicians were involved in 
this study. 
The patients were admitted to the hospital one day 
prior to the procedure. ESD was performed using the 
Olympus-Medical (Tokyo, Japan) Dual knife, Hook knife, 
and IT knife, as per the surgeon's preference. Sodium 
hyaluronate and saline solution were used for submu-
cosal injection, and VIO 300D (ERBE, Germany) was 
used to generate high frequencies. Intraoperative anes-
thesia was administered with small doses of midazolam 
or flunitrazepam as a sedative and pethidine hydrochlo-
ride as the analgesic. Hemostasis of the ulcer base after 
ESD was achieved through cauterization using hemo-
static forceps or the clip method;polyglycolic acid sheets 
were occasionally used to cover or close the ulcer base 
when using the clip method. Patients were administered 
20 mg omeprazole twice daily as they were fasting on 

the day of treatment and the following day.Subsequently, 
omeprazole was replaced with 30 mg oral lansoprazole, 
20 mg esomeprazole, or 20 mg vonoprazan fumarate 
before meals. Some surgeons performed second-look 
endoscopy the day after treatment. Barring complica-
tions, most patients were discharged within 5-6 days 
postoperatively. 

Patient selection 

We evaluated all cases of ESD performed at our 
hospital between May 2003 and July 2021 that were 
registered in the database. We followed up patients in 
the usual outpatient setting for ≥1 year, barring spe-
cial circumstances. Patients with submucosal tumors, 
hyperplastic polyps, non-carcinomas or non-adenomas, 
or missing required data were excluded. 
Cases were divided into two groups: those who under-
went ESD before and those who underwent ESD after 
July 2017, the time of publication of the supplemen-
tal guidelines. If multiple lesions were resected en 
bloc, they were considered a single case. Anticoagu-
lants were defined as warfarin and DOACs (dabigatran, 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). 

Study variables 

The variables in this study included patient character-
istics (age and sex), medications at the time of ESD 
(types of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and steroids), 
comorbidities at the time of ESD (atrial fibrillation, 
valvular disease, deep vein thrombosis, diabetes mel-
litus, hemodialysis, and liver cirrhosis), lesions (site, 
resection specimen size, procedure time, macroscopic 
type, ulcer, histology, and depth of invasion), and patient 
outcomes (curability of ESD, intraoperative and post-
operative perforation, postoperative bleeding, death, 
and thromboembolism associated with withdrawal of 
anticoagulants). Antiplatelet agents included aspirin, 
cilostazol, and P2Y12 receptor antagonists. Anticoagu-
lants and antiplatelet agents were collectively referred 
to as antithrombotic agents. Withdrawal and resumption 
of antithrombotic drugs were based on the guidelines 
and decisions of the attending physicians. However, 
a few patients discontinued the drugs independently 
or extended the withdrawal period at the discretion 
of their physicians. Post-ESD bleeding was defined 
as hematemesis or hemoptysis and a decrease in 
post-ESD peripheral blood hemoglobin level by at least 
2.0 g/dl. 

Statistical analysis 

R ver. 3.6.3 was used for statistical analysis (R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The

t-test, Wilcoxon test, and chi-square test were used 
to compare the two groups. Risk factors were evalu-
ated using univariate analysis. The data of the pre-
publication cohort were used to predict bleeding using a 
logistic regression model. Variables that were significant 
in the univariate analysis and those identified as clini-
cally significant in previous studies were included in the 
multivariate regression. Receiver-operating characteris-
tic (ROC) curves were created to evaluate the goodness 
of fit. Bootstrap was used to evaluate the internal valid-
ity. The prediction model created for the pre-publication 
cohort was applied to the data of the post-publication 
cohort to evaluate the external validity. The Kaplan-
Meier curve was used to plot postoperative bleeding up 
to 14 days after ESD. Statistical significance was set at 
p < 0.05. 

RESULTS 

Our database included 2423 gastric ESD cases 
between May 2003 and June 2021. We limited gas-
tric tumors to early carcinomas and adenomas and 
excluded other lesions and those with incomplete data 
and finally included 2272 cases. We assigned 1789 
cases before and 483 cases after the publication of the

increase in the proportion of patients administered 
DOACs and a decrease in that administered warfarin. 
The proportion of patients with heparin replacement 
decreased, but there was no change in the incidences of 
underlying conditions. A comparison of gastric tumors 
between the groups is summarized in Table 1b; there 
was an increase in the percentage of lesions in the M 
region, decreased resection specimen size, and reduced 
procedure time. There was also an increase in the pro-
portion of undifferentiated carcinomas. A comparison of 
outcomes between the groups is presented in Table 1c. 
Although the perforation rate decreased, there was no 
change in the incidence of post-ESD bleeding. The over-
all post-ESD bleeding rate was 2.68% (61/2272). Two 
cases of thromboembolism associated with withdrawal 
of anticoagulant agents accounted for 1.28% (2/152) of 
patients administered anticoagulants. 

Risk factors for post-ESD bleeding 

Bleeding and non-bleeding cases were compared in the 
pre-and post-publication cohorts, and risk factors were 

examined in the univariate analysis (Table 2). Patients 
undergoing heparin replacement or hemodialysis had 
a higher risk for post-ESD bleeding. For anticoagu-
lants, 18.6% of all warfarin-treated patients experienced 
bleeding, with a significant difference in the propor-
tion experiencing bleeding in the pre-publication cohort. 
For DOACs, there were fewer cases of bleeding, but 
a significant difference in the proportion of patients 
who experienced bleeding in the post-publication cohort. 
However, there were no clear differences between types 
of DOAC.For lesion-related factors,we found that resec-
tion specimen size may be a risk factor for post-ESD 
bleeding. 

Predictive model for post-ESD bleeding 

In creating the predictive model in the pre-publication 
cohort, we included known risk factors, such as 
antithrombotic agents, heparin replacement, and 
hemodialysis as explanatory variables when perform-
ing logistic regression analysis. Additionally, we added 
resection specimen size, which was a significant risk

factor in the univariate analysis. We added the resection 
time as the last variable because it was expected to 
have a strong influence on post-ESD bleeding. The cut-
off values for resection specimen size and procedure 
time were 38 mm and 139 min, respectively, based on 
the ROC analysis. Five variables were incorporated into 
the model, within one-tenth of the number of bleeding 
events, and we considered overfitting acceptable. The 

products of all the variables were fed into the model, 
and no interaction was found for any combination. The 
coefficient of variance magnification was <10 for all 
variables. 
The ROC curve was used to evaluate the good-
ness of fit of the model, and the C-statistic was 0.83

a The risk of bleeding was quantified in risk points based on the partial regression coefficient of each variable. 

When Bootstrap (R = 1000) was conducted to assess 
the internal validity, the mean C-statistic was 0.83 
(95% CI 0.76-0.89). When the model created in the 
pre-publication cohort was incorporated into the post-
publication cohort to assess the external validity, the 
C-statistic was 0.72 (95% CI 0.57-0.87). 
The BEST-J score, 13 a predictive model with 10 vari-
ables, had an area under the ROC curve (area under the 
curve [AUC]) of 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-0.93) when applied 
to the post-publication cohort of this study. We used 
DeLong's test to compare the AUC of the model in this 
study and the AUC based on the BEST-J score, and 
found no significant difference (p = 0.911). 
In the final model (Table 3), the risk of bleeding was 
quantified based on the partial regression coefficients 
for each variable. We set 1 point for one antithrombotic 
medication, 2 for ≥2 antithrombotic medications, 3 for 
heparin replacement and hemodialysis, 2 for resec-
tion specimen size ≥38 mm, and 1 for procedure time 
≥139 min. We classified the total points of quantified 
bleeding risk into three groups: low-risk (0-3 points: 
1.6-4.0), intermediate-risk (4-5 points: 8.4-13.1), and 
high-risk (6-8 points: 21.2-34.8), with reference to the 
positive likelihood ratio. 

Distributions of the risk score and classification in the 
pre-publication cohort are summarized in Table 4. The 
bleeding rates at low, intermediate, and high risks were 
1.6%, 10.3%, and 38.9%, respectively. 
Similarly, the distributions of risk scores and classi-
fication in the post-publication cohort are presented in 
Table 5. The bleeding rates were 0.9%, 9.5%, and 14.3% 
in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups, 
respectively.The bleeding rate in the high-risk group was 
lower than that in the pre-publication cohort. Finally, the 
time to bleeding curve for each risk category is shown 
in Figure 3; there was a significant difference in the inci-
dence of postoperative bleeding up to 14 days after ESD 
in both the pre-and post-publication cohorts.

Summary of results 

In this study, we clarified the changes in gastric ESD 
before and after the publication of the supplementary 
guidelines. We also identified risk factors for post-ESD 
bleeding and developed a predictive model. Despite a

ESD techniques. The increase in the number of lesions

carcinoma may be due to improvements in endoscopic 
performance and image quality. 

Comparison with previous studies 

Unlike previous reports, 10 the type of DOAC was not 
an independent risk factor for post-ESD bleeding in this 
study. We speculate that this was due to an insufficient 
number of patients and fewer bleeding events (apixa-
ban, n = 2; rivaroxaban and edoxaban, n = 1 each). The 
definition of bleeding in this study was based on previ-
ous reports, 14 and although slightly lower, the bleeding 
rate in this study was similar to those in previous reports. 
However, the resection specimen size was a significant 
risk factor for post-ESD bleeding in this study, as in a 
previous study. 15 One previous large study 13 that also 
developed a predictive model for bleeding after ESD lim-
ited the cases to those with early gastric cancer, while 
our study included those with early gastric cancer and 
adenoma. Additionally, our study included cases treated 
after the publication of the supplemental guidelines, 
unlike previous studies. 

Clinical implications 

Two cases of thromboembolism associated with anti-
coagulant withdrawal were observed in this study and 
involved warfarin replacement with heparin. The sup-
plemental guidelines recommend endoscopic treatment 
with continuous warfarin therapy if the prothrombin time-
international normalized ratio is within the therapeutic 
range or a temporary change to DOAC for non-valvular 
atrial fibrillation. Both cases were noted before the 
publication of the supplemental guidelines. Therefore, 
the supplement recommending short-term withdrawal 
or continuation of antithrombotic agents may prevent 
thromboembolism without increasing the postoperative 
bleeding rate. 
Only five variables were incorporated into the predic-
tion model because of the number of events in the pre-
publication group. The following were significant: "two 
or more antithrombotic medications," "heparin replace-
ment," "hemodialysis," and "specimen size ≥38 mm." 
All variables are known or expected to contribute to 
postoperative bleeding. "Two or more antithrombotic 
medications," "heparin replacement," "hemodialysis," and 
"large specimen size" are reported risk factors for 
postoperative bleeding. 9,10,15,16 Although there are no 
reports of "procedure time" as a risk factor, we included 
it because it is likely to be influenced by a combination 
of the surgeon's skill, surgical difficulty, and frequency of 
intraoperative bleeding and hemostasis. 
Regarding the Kaplan-Meier curve, the high-risk 
group was clearly more likely to bleed within 14 days 
after the endoscopic procedure. Therefore, additional 

endoscopic observation should be considered not only 
immediately after but also during the 1-2 weeks after 
the procedure. 

Limitations and strengths 

The reduction in the operative time before and after 
the publication of the guidelines suggests that ESD 
techniques may have improved over time, possibly intro-
ducing bias. Furthermore, this study was limited by 
its single-center, retrospective nature. Compared with 
previous multicenter studies 15 that developed predic-
tion models for post-ESD bleeding, fewer cases were 
included in this study; therefore, only five variables were 
included in the model. However, the performance of the 
model was good, with an AUC of 0.83, better than that in 
previous studies. Even after the publication of the sup-
plementary guidelines, the model's accuracy remained 
good, with an AUC of 0.72. Generally, the accuracy of 
risk models declines as the environment changes over 
time. 17 The model in this study functioned effectively 
even when the time axis was different and clinical prac-
tice was supposed to be different due to changes in the 
guidelines, thus indicating its robustness. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study 
to compare the results of a predictive model for post-
ESD bleeding before and after the publication of these 
supplementary guidelines. In other words, this study is 
the first to show that a prediction model based on pre-
publication data can be applied to post-publication data 
and that the AUC for post-publication data can be as 
good as 0.72. Furthermore, this study suggests that the 
BEST-J score of Hatta et al. 13 may also be applicable 
to daily practice. We conduct our daily practice in accor-
dance with the supplemental guidelines and believe that 
this is of sufficient clinical significance. On the other 
hand, the predictive model in this study produced com-
parable results with fewer variables than the BEST-J 
score. Although this is another strength of this study, it 
is necessary to examine the generalizability and inter-
institutional differences using multicenter studies in the 
future. 

CONCLUSION 

There were changes in patient characteristics and clin-
ical practice regarding ESD after the publication of the 
supplementary guidelines. Nevertheless, we developed 
a predictive model for post-ESD bleeding that main-
tained accuracy over time. In the future, we would like 
to introduce the developed model into clinical prac-
tice and conduct interventional studies, such as the 
incorporation of prophylactic hemostasis in high-risk 
patients and active endoscopic observation the day after 
ESD.
