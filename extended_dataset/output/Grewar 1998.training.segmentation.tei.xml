			<front>Hay fever symptoms 4 -<lb/>and over-the-rn <lb/>counter remedies: a community <lb/>pharmacy study <lb/>J. GREWAR and T. M. MACDONALD <lb/></front>

			<body>There is poor understanding of patients&apos; perceptions of hay fever symptoms, the <lb/>factors which motivate them to purchase particular products and what properties <lb/>they deem desirable in a remedy. This study aimed to increase understanding of <lb/>patients&apos; perceptions of hay fever symptoms and to investigate their perceptions <lb/>of five non-sedating oral antihistamine products and a corticosteroid nasal spray. <lb/>A sample of 249 patients was recruited from community pharmacies from June <lb/>to August, 1995. Of these, 139 (56 per cent) returned questionnaires, of which <lb/>124 were valid for analysis. The most common symptoms experienced were nasal <lb/>and ocular. The most common early warning sign of hay fever was sneezing (75; <lb/>21 per cent). Forty-three subjects (35 per cent) indicated there was less than half <lb/>an hour between the first sign of an attack and developing all symptoms, and 87 <lb/>(70 per cent) reported developing all symptoms in under two hours. For 45 <lb/>subjects (36 per cent) the worst period for the attack was the morning. The most <lb/>common way of treating a hay fever attack was by taking a remedy at the first <lb/>sign of hay fever (70; 56 per cent). Seventy-six (61 per cent) used the remedy <lb/>once daily and 120 (96 per cent) once or twice daily. Eighty-five (69 per cent) <lb/>used the remedy every day of the week during an attack. A reduction in sneezing <lb/>was the most common indicator that the remedy was working (50; 21 per cent). <lb/>The most common reason for purchasing a remedy was the pharmacist&apos;s <lb/>recommendation (45; 33 per cent). The most common reason for acquiring the <lb/>remedy by over-the-counter (OTC) purchase was that it was more convenient <lb/>than consulting a general medical practitioner (GP) (77; 42 per cent). The most <lb/>common reason for liking a particular remedy was that it gave fast relief (35; 21 <lb/>per cent). The most common reason for disliking a remedy was that it was <lb/>expensive (21; 28 per cent). Most patients (108; 87 per cent) were either &quot;very&quot; <lb/>or &quot;fairly&quot; satisfied with their remedy. The top three most important desired <lb/>properties of an &quot;ideal&quot; hay fever remedy were that it was fast acting, gave long <lb/>lasting relief and did not cause drowsiness. <lb/>HAY fever is the most common cause of allergy <lb/>in the United Kingdom, affecting approximately <lb/>15 per cent of the population. In 1990, an esti-<lb/>mated 570,000 people reported hay fever symp-<lb/>toms in the UK, of whom 402,000 (71 per cent) <lb/>were aged between 16 and 44 years.&apos; <lb/>Hay fever is caused by allergy to pollen, with <lb/>most problems occurring in the summer being <lb/>caused by grass pollen. The main symptoms in-<lb/>clude nose irritation and itching, sneezing, run-<lb/>ning and blockage. Eyes may become itchy and <lb/>watery. The palate, throat and ears may also be-<lb/>come itchy. There may be headaches and a gen-<lb/>eral feeling of lethargy and loss of concentration. <lb/>Pollens may also trigger asthma symptoms <lb/>(cough, chest tightness and wheezing). <lb/>In recent years, more patients have consulted <lb/>their general medical practitioner (GP) or phar-<lb/>macist because of hay fever symptoms, although <lb/>it is not clear whether this reflects a true increase <lb/>in incidence of the disease or an increase in <lb/>awareness of it. Although past research has com-<lb/>pared the control of hay fever symptoms by dif-<lb/>ferent hay fever products,2-5 relatively few <lb/>products have been evaluated in the setting in <lb/>which they will be used.6 Despite our poor un-<lb/>derstanding of hay fever symptoms and remedies <lb/>from a consumer&apos;s perspective, demand for over <lb/></body>

			<body>fever treatments increased in 1994 by 9.2 per <lb/>cent in volume terms (18.7 per cent by value), <lb/>compared with 0.8 per cent (6.5 per cent by val-<lb/>ue) for OTC medicines in general.&apos; <lb/>Sales of all OTC medicines are now equivalent <lb/>to a third of the National Health Service (NHS) <lb/>drugs bi11.6 This trend towards increased self care <lb/>has many potential benefits and pitfalls, and re-<lb/>quires more research. Such research should result <lb/>in pharmacists being better equipped to make <lb/>value judgments on the choice of such medicines <lb/>when responding to patients&apos; symptoms.2 <lb/>The present study was designed to increase our <lb/>understanding of hay fever symptoms from the <lb/>patient&apos;s perspective. It also examined how six <lb/>hay fever remedies were used and the patients&apos; <lb/>rationale for treatment. Choice of a particular <lb/>remedy and reasons for purchasing it from a <lb/>pharmacy rather than acquiring it by consulting <lb/>a GP were also investigated. Finally, patients&apos; <lb/>level of satisfaction with several OTC hay fever <lb/>remedies was assessed and the desired properties <lb/>of an &quot;ideal&quot; hay fever remedy investigated. <lb/>Method <lb/>The study was conducted in six community phar-<lb/>macies in the Tayside area of Scotland and one <lb/>in the Lanarkshire area of Scotland which had <lb/>been approached and had agreed to take part. <lb/>Five were independent pharmacies and one was <lb/>a supermarket pharmacy. The study took place <lb/>in June to August, 1995, and involved patients <lb/>responding to a questionnaire. <lb/>Ethics approval The study was submitted to Tay-<lb/>side committee on medical research ethics and <lb/>Lanarkshire health board ethics of research com-<lb/>mittee. Both committees approved the study <lb/>without the requirement for written informed <lb/>consent as this was deemed to be implied by the <lb/>questionnaire being returned. <lb/>Training Before starting the study, an informa-<lb/>tion pack was prepared, to act as a reference <lb/>source in each pharmacy and provide the basis <lb/>for training of pharmacy assistants. Training of <lb/>pharmacy assistants (by JG) was conducted in <lb/>the pharmacies, on a one-to-one basis, and cov-<lb/>ered study background, aims and objectives, re-<lb/>cruitment procedure, paperwork and use of the <lb/>information pack. <lb/>Recruitment The sample population comprised <lb/>volunteers purchasing any hay fever treatment <lb/>from the following study product list: Beconase <lb/>Hayfever nasal spray, Clarityn tablets, Seldane <lb/>tablets, Triludan tablets, Triludan Forte tablets <lb/>and Zirtek tablets. An equal number of patients <lb/>was required to be recruited into each treatment <lb/>group, with Seldane, Triludan and Triludan <lb/>Forte being considered one group. We aimed to <lb/>recruit 300 patients during the hay fever season. <lb/>Pharmacists and pharmacy assistants were in-<lb/>volved in the recruitment procedure. <lb/>Patients were only approached and invited to <lb/>participate in the study after they had freely pur-<lb/>chased their hay fever remedy. Those expressing <lb/>interest were given verbal information on the <lb/>study, then after agreeing verbally to take part in <lb/>the study, the patient was assessed for suitabili-<lb/>ty according to the following inclusion criteria: <lb/>the patient was over the age of 18 years and must <lb/>(a) have had hay fever symptoms and intended <lb/>to use their hay fever remedy at the time of pur-<lb/>chase, or (b) anticipate developing symptoms <lb/>and using their hay fever remedy during the cur-<lb/>rent hay fever season. Only one study hay fever <lb/>remedy was to have been purchased at the point <lb/>of study entry for the patient&apos;s own use. <lb/>Patients were excluded according to the fol-<lb/>lowing exclusion criteria: those who (a) pur-<lb/>chased a study product for a third party, or (b) <lb/>were currently taking other hay fever remedies or <lb/>any medicine which could affect allergy symp-<lb/>toms. <lb/>It was made clear that participation was en-<lb/>tirely voluntary and subjects could withdraw at <lb/>any time. N o incentive was offered to patients to <lb/>return their questionnaire. No reminder letters <lb/>were sent but one pharmacy made one telephone <lb/>call to remind non-returnees to return their ques-<lb/>tionnaire. This was not a protocol requirement <lb/>and the pharmacist in question instigated this of <lb/>his own volition. <lb/>Each pharmacy was issued with a set of study <lb/>packs each containing a patient information let-<lb/>ter, a questionnaire and a stamped addressed en-<lb/>velope. Subjects were required to complete the <lb/>questionnaire after the remedy pack had been <lb/>finished or when symptoms were relieved, <lb/>whichever was the sooner, and to return it in the <lb/>stamped addressed envelope (addressed to the re-<lb/>search pharmacist, Medicines Monitoring Unit). <lb/>If the remedy was not taken as intended during <lb/>the hay fever season, the patient was required to <lb/>indicate this on the questionnaire and to return <lb/>it at the end of the hay fever season. <lb/>An abridged version of the questionnaire is <lb/>shown in Appendix 1. Weekly telephone contact <lb/>was made with all pharmacies to obtain recruit-<lb/>ment figures and to discuss recruitment problems <lb/>or matters relating to the study. <lb/>Data collection The data were collected and <lb/>analysed using Epi-info (version 5).* Each phar-<lb/>macy was sent a set of their results when all data <lb/>had been collated and analysed. <lb/>Results <lb/>Two hundred and forty-nine subjects were re-<lb/>cruited between June 12 and August 11, 1995, <lb/>inclusive. One hundred and thirty-nine question-<lb/>naires (56 per cent) were returned by August 25, <lb/>1995. The proportion of questionnaires returned <lb/></body>

			<body>by each pharmacy ranged from 0 per cent to 87.5 <lb/>per cent. No questionnaires were illegible or <lb/>spoiled. The pharmacy which used telephone re-<lb/>minders to non-responders achieved a 74 per <lb/>cent return rate. <lb/>Of the seven participating community phar-<lb/>macies, two used only the pharmacist to recruit, <lb/>one used only the pharmacy assistants, three <lb/>used both the pharmacist and pharmacy assis-<lb/>tants and one did not record the recruiter. <lb/>An attempt was made to recruit an equal num-<lb/>ber of patients using each remedy, with the ter-<lb/>fenadine-containing products Seldane, Triludan <lb/>and Triludan Forte being regarded as one reme-<lb/>dy. This proved difficult, due to the considerably <lb/>higher demand for Triludan compared with the <lb/>other products, and the limited duration of the <lb/>hay fever season. <lb/>Table 1 shows recruitment and returned ques-<lb/>tionnaires by remedy. Fifteen questionnaires <lb/>were invalid because they had been completed by <lb/>a patient taking more than one study product, or <lb/>taking a study product and a medicine which <lb/>could affect allergy symptoms, or taking a non-<lb/>study product. Therefore, 124 returned ques-<lb/>tionnaires were included in the analysis. <lb/>Table 2 shows participants&apos; symptoms classi-<lb/>fied according to degree of severity. The most <lb/>common symptoms (experienced to a mild, mod-<lb/>erate or severe degree) affected the nose (report-<lb/>ed in 438 responses), followed by eyes (197 <lb/>responses). <lb/>Sneezing was the most common early warning <lb/>sign, occurring in 75 responses (21 per cent), fol-<lb/>lowed by runny nose (62 responses; 17 per cent) <lb/>and itchy eyes (58 responses; 16 per cent). <lb/>Forty-three patients (35 per cent) indicated <lb/>that less than half an hour elapsed between the <lb/>first sign of a hay fever attack and having all <lb/>symptoms. Eighty-seven patients (70 per cent) re-<lb/>ported having all symptoms in under two hours. <lb/>The worst period for hay fever attacks was in <lb/>the morning, as indicated on 45 questionnaires <lb/>(36 per cent). The &quot;best&quot; period was during the <lb/>night, as indicated on three questionnaires (two <lb/>per cent). <lb/>Table 3 shows that the most common way of <lb/>treating a hay fever attack was taking the reme-<lb/>dy at the first sign of a hay fever attack, as re-<lb/>ported on 70 questionnaires (56 per cent). <lb/>Seventy-six patients (61 per cent) reported tha <lb/>the remedy was used once daily and 120 (96 pe <lb/>cent) reported that it was used once or twice dai <lb/>ly. One patient indicated that Triludan Forte wa <lb/>taken &quot;five times or more&quot; daily. Eighty-nine pe <lb/>cent of patients using a remedy with a once dai <lb/>ly dosage took it accordingly, compared with 51 <lb/>per cent of patients using a remedy with a twic <lb/>daily dosage. <lb/>Eighty-five patients (69 per cent) indicate1 <lb/>that the hay fever remedy was used on every da <lb/>of the week during an attack. All 24 patient <lb/>(100 per cent) using Beconase Hayfever report <lb/>ed that they used it on every day of the week <lb/>The hay fever remedy was used on one or twc <lb/>days of the week in 12 responses (nine per cent] <lb/>Table 4 summarises the symptomatic relief ex <lb/>perienced by patients. With oral antihistamines <lb/>the most common relief was a reduction in sneez <lb/>ing (38 responses; 21 per cent), followed by a re <lb/>duction in itchy eyes (34 responses; 18 per cent <lb/>and a reduction in runny nose (31 responses; 1&apos; <lb/>per cent). <lb/>With Beconase Hayfever, the most commoi <lb/>type of symptomatic relief was a reduction ii <lb/>sneezing (12 responses; 24 per cent), followed b <lb/>improvement in blocked nose (eight responses <lb/>16 per cent). The latter was the only differenc <lb/>in symptomatic relief between Beconas <lb/>Hayfever and oral antihistamines which was sta <lb/>tistically significant (P&lt;0.05). <lb/>Almost half of the patients (11; 42 per cent <lb/>indicated that the choice of a nasal spray wa <lb/>made in preference to tablets because tablet <lb/>Table 1: Recruitment and returned questionnaires by <lb/>remedy <lb/>Remedy <lb/>Recruited Returned questionnaire <lb/>Beconase <lb/>Clarityn <lb/>39 <lb/>21 <lb/>54.0 <lb/>Seldane <lb/>9 <lb/>5 <lb/>56.0 <lb/>Triludan <lb/>98 <lb/>46 <lb/>47.0 <lb/>Triludan Forte <lb/>16 <lb/>14 <lb/>87.5 <lb/>Zinek <lb/>30 <lb/>14 <lb/>47.0 <lb/>56.0 <lb/>Total <lb/>249 <lb/>139 <lb/>Number <lb/>Number Percentage <lb/>Hayfever <lb/>48 <lb/>24 <lb/>50.0 <lb/>Others <lb/>9* <lb/>1st <lb/>includes five non-study remedies and four unknown study <lb/>products (not recorded) <lb/>t invalid <lb/>Table 2: Responses to question: To what extent did you have the following symptoms during this hay fever attack? <lb/>(n=124) <lb/>Symptom <lb/>Mild <lb/>Moderate <lb/>Severe <lb/>Total <lb/>Affecting nose <lb/>116 <lb/>26.0 <lb/>194 <lb/>44.0 <lb/>128 <lb/>29.0 <lb/>438 <lb/>99.0 <lb/>Number Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage <lb/>Affecting eyes <lb/>59 <lb/>30.0 <lb/>70 <lb/>35.5 <lb/>68 <lb/>34.5 <lb/>197 <lb/>100.0 <lb/>Affecting mouthlthroat <lb/>36 <lb/>40.0 <lb/>35 <lb/>39.0 <lb/>19 <lb/>21.0 <lb/>90 <lb/>100.0 <lb/>Wheezing <lb/>17 <lb/>46.0 <lb/>13 <lb/>35.0 <lb/>7 <lb/>19.0 <lb/>37 <lb/>100.0 <lb/>Headache <lb/>20 <lb/>41.0 <lb/>22 <lb/>45.0 <lb/>7 <lb/>14.0 <lb/>49 <lb/>100.0 <lb/>cough <lb/>19 <lb/>49.0 <lb/>13 <lb/>33.0 <lb/>7 <lb/>18.0 <lb/>39 <lb/>100.0 <lb/>Catarrh <lb/>20 <lb/>40.0 <lb/>20 <lb/>40.0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20.0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100.0 <lb/>Affecting ears <lb/>2 <lb/>28.5 <lb/>2 <lb/>28.5 <lb/>3 <lb/>43.0 <lb/>7 <lb/>100.0 <lb/>Others <lb/>0 <lb/>0.0 <lb/>1 <lb/>33.0 <lb/>2 <lb/>67.0 <lb/>3 <lb/>100.0 <lb/></body>

			<body>subsequent recruitment of patients on these <lb/>products was halted for three weeks in the hope <lb/>of the other remedies &quot;catching up.&quot; However, <lb/>this resulted in overall recruitment being retard-<lb/>ed. <lb/>The proportion of questionnaires returned (56 <lb/>per cent), although quite respectable, was much <lb/>lower than the 78 per cent achieved in our pre-<lb/>vious OTC medicines research methodology <lb/>study.9 This may have been due to several dif-<lb/>ferences between the studies. The hay fever ques-<lb/>tionnaire was longer (containing 19 questions <lb/>compared with 11) and the questions were more <lb/>complex. Furthermore, the hay fever questions <lb/>were less scientific and more of a market research <lb/>nature. This may have affected patients&apos; percep-<lb/>tion of the relevance, and indeed the importance, <lb/>of the data and may have exerted a negative in-<lb/>fluence on their decision to return the question-<lb/>naire. <lb/>The fact that signed informed consent from <lb/>patients was not required by both ethics com-<lb/>mittees was beneficial in simplifying the recruit-<lb/>ment procedure but may have had a detrimental <lb/>effect on patients&apos; willingness to return the ques-<lb/>tionnaire by undermining the importance of the <lb/>data. Furthermore, unlike in the OTC medicines <lb/>research methodology study,9 apart from one <lb/>pharmacy where patient names and telephone <lb/>numbers were taken, there were no demograph-<lb/>ic details recorded at the point of recruitment <lb/>that would facilitate follow-up; hence patients <lb/>were aware that follow-up was impossible, and <lb/>this may also have discouraged questionnaire re-<lb/>turn. <lb/>The pharmacy using a telephone call reminder <lb/>for non-responders achieved the second highest <lb/>return rate. This pharmacy and the one with no <lb/>returned questionnaires served the least affluent <lb/>community of those involved. In this instance, <lb/>the telephone reminder appeared to improve the <lb/>return rate, as might have been predicted.10 In <lb/>general, the pharmacies involved in this study <lb/>served less affluent communities than those in <lb/>the OTC medicines research methodology study9 <lb/>and this may have exerted a negative influence <lb/>on questionnaire returns.10 The differences in re-<lb/>turn rate between pharmacies may be due to <lb/>pharmacy location but our results suggest that a <lb/>&quot;pharmacy effect&quot; may also be a contributory <lb/>factor. <lb/>The products in this study were chosen as a <lb/>sample of popular &quot;newer&quot; hay fever remedies. <lb/>Perhaps a sedating antihistamine such as chlor-<lb/>pheniramine (Piriton) should have been included <lb/>as a study product.

			<body>fever attack most commonly occurred in the <lb/>morning, and not in the evening when pollen <lb/>counts tend to be higher. The traditional view is <lb/>that pollen rises on warm air in the middle of the <lb/>day and falls in late afternoon and evening when <lb/>sufferers tend to complain of symptoms. Our <lb/>study agrees with a British Allergy Foundation <lb/>study,&quot; which found that 36 per cent of respon-<lb/>dents felt worst before l p m in the afternoon. <lb/>This supports the belief that hay fever is not just <lb/>related to pollen levels which vary throughout <lb/>the day, but is complicated by a number of oth-<lb/>er factors which may include exercise, emotion-<lb/>al factors and environmental pollution. <lb/>Table 3 showed that the most common way of <lb/>treating a hay fever attack was by taking the rem-<lb/>edy at the first sign of hay fever so that the symp-<lb/>toms would not be so bad. This result is <lb/>predictable if one considers the detrimental effect <lb/>that hay fever can have on peoples&apos; lifestyle. The <lb/>British Allergy Foundation study&quot; found that 53 <lb/>per cent of respondents were stopped from go-<lb/>ing outside, 25 per cent from playing sport and <lb/>nine per cent from going to work as a result of <lb/>hay fever. It is interesting that relatively few pa-<lb/>tients started taking the remedy before the sea-<lb/>son to prevent symptoms from developing. It is <lb/>understood that Beconase Hayfever should work <lb/>better when started before the season begins,12 <lb/>but pre-season use was not a main feature of Be-<lb/>conase Hayfever use in our sample. <lb/>Our study showed that a high pollen forecast <lb/>had no effect on how respondents treated their <lb/>hay fever attack. Hay fever sufferers are often <lb/>well aware that pollen levels can exert a consid-<lb/>erable influence on their symptoms, but since our <lb/>sample appeared to use their remedies as reliev-<lb/>ers, pollen forecasts would be unimportant, as <lb/>Dur results show. <lb/>Our results on once and twice daily dosage <lb/>remedies highlight poorer compliance in the case <lb/>D f remedies with a twice daily dosage. A similar <lb/>trend was found in a Swedish study on oral an-<lb/>tihistamines, reported as a poster at the 1996 In-<lb/>ternational Social Pharmacy Workshop in <lb/>Madison, Wisconsin. This study found 71 per <lb/>cent (n=194) and 40 per cent (n=65) compliance <lb/>with once and twice daily dosage remedies, re-<lb/>spectively. Perhaps some clients are getting ade-<lb/>quate symptom relief by taking a twice daily <lb/>dosage remedy on a once a day basis. Further re-<lb/>search is required to answer this point. One re-<lb/>spondent in our study took Triludan Forte &quot;five <lb/>times or more daily.&quot; This may have been an er-<lb/>ror in taking the medication or possibly a record-<lb/>ing error by the patient. <lb/>Our results showed that use every day of the <lb/>week during a hay fever attack is common with <lb/>Beconase Hayfever, as one would expect for <lb/>maximum effect with a topical steroid. A rela-<lb/>tively high proportion of patients (69 per cent) <lb/>indicated that antihistamines were also used ev-<lb/>try day during an attack. This chronic use of &quot;re-<lb/>lievers&quot; may be because patients have found that <lb/>continuous treatment is necessary to relieve <lb/>symptoms, or because patients are using the rem-<lb/>edy for longer than is necessary for fear of symp-<lb/>toms reappearing when they discontinue <lb/>treatment. The patients (nine per cent) who used <lb/>their remedy on one or two days of the week dur-<lb/>ing an attack may be people taking oral antihis-<lb/>tamines only when they get symptoms. Further <lb/>research on the duration of treatment episodes <lb/>may be worthwhile. <lb/>The three most frequently cited symptomatic <lb/>improvements which indicated that the remedy <lb/>was working were a decrease in sneezing, a de-<lb/>crease in itchy eyes and a decrease in runny nose <lb/>(Table 4). These match some of the most com-<lb/>monly reported symptoms suffered during a hay <lb/>fever attack. This would indicate that the reme-<lb/>dies are, in fact, targeting the appropriate symp-<lb/>toms. <lb/>A greater proportion of participants using Be-<lb/>conase Hayfever than of those using oral anti-<lb/>histamines indicated relief of blocked nose, as <lb/>one would expect, but there was no significant <lb/>difference in other symptomatic relief. <lb/>Eleven patients (42 per cent) reported that a <lb/>topical corticosteroid was chosen in preference <lb/>to antihistamine tablets because of lack of effi-<lb/>cacy of the latter on their symptoms. Guidelines <lb/>for OTC treatment of hay fever12 indicate that <lb/>topical corticosteroid treatment is more effective <lb/>than antihistamines against nasal symptoms <lb/>(runny, itchy or blocked nose and sneezing) and <lb/>runny, itchy eyes. Other studies comparing hay <lb/>fever remedies 4.5 do not support this. Debate in <lb/>this area appears to continue, and further re-<lb/>search is required. <lb/>The pharmacist&apos;s recommendation was the <lb/>most important reason for patients to purchase <lb/>a particular hay fever remedy. This supports the <lb/>belief that, in the hay fever market, patient loy-<lb/>alty is relatively low, with the strongest influence <lb/>on purchase being recommendation, particularly <lb/>by the pharmacist or the pharmacy assistant. <lb/>Our results may also reflect the fact that more <lb/>people are seeking their pharmacist&apos;s advice on <lb/>OTC medicines and, indeed, that more advice is <lb/>being offered by pharmacists and pharmacy as-<lb/>sistants. <lb/>Other reasons reported for buying a particular <lb/>hay fever remedy are noteworthy. Twenty-five <lb/>responses (18 per cent) indicated that patients <lb/>had previously obtained their remedy on pre-<lb/>scription. One patient bought a remedy because <lb/>it did not cause drowsiness. <lb/>The two most common reasons for purchasing <lb/>the hay fever remedy rather than obtaining a pre-<lb/>scription for it were convenience and immediate <lb/>need. The former reason is supported by the <lb/>Swedish research mentioned earlier, and both are <lb/>fairly predictable in the light of current find-<lb/>ings.13 In the UK, the likelihood of purchasing <lb/>OTC medicines is linked with the patient&apos;s ex-<lb/></body>

			<body>emption status from prescription costs. Over 80 <lb/>per cent of NHS prescriptions are exempt from <lb/>prescription charges, and this is likely to influ-<lb/>ence consumers&apos; decisions about self-medica-<lb/>tion.13 A recent study showed that a key factor <lb/>in determining patient choice between OTC or <lb/>prescribed acquisition of a hay fever remedy was <lb/>whether they were exempt from prescription <lb/>charges.14 In our study, the 21 subjects (11 per <lb/>cent) who indicated that it was cheaper to buy <lb/>were probably patients who were liable for pre-<lb/>scription charges. Many packs contain a limited <lb/>supply of remedy, so for sufferers requiring <lb/>chronic treatment the supply of greater quanti-<lb/>ties of medicines on prescription encourages con-<lb/>sultation with their GP.13 Alternatively, patients <lb/>may have perceived OTC acquisition to be <lb/>cheaper because of the travel and time costs in-<lb/>volved in consulting their GP. <lb/>The three most commonly liked properties of <lb/>hay fever remedies, namely, that the remedy was <lb/>fast-acting, effective and non-sedating, are fairly <lb/>predictable, but surprisingly only one person <lb/>[Table 5 ) mentioned non-sedating as a reason for <lb/>:hoosing the product they actually bought. <lb/>The most commonly disliked property of a <lb/>remedy was that it was expensive. We have no <lb/>ndication of the parameters used by participants <lb/>for measuring cost. It might have been consid-<lb/>:red solely on the basis of retail price or daily <lb/>:reatment cost, with factors such as convenience, <lb/>accessibility and time saved on consultation with <lb/>:he GP overlooked. <lb/>Other research supports our findings on the in-<lb/>hence of cost on product choice.14 Neither likes <lb/>ior dislikes were placed in rank order or quan-<lb/>:ified, so we have no means of assessing their rel-<lb/>itive importance. <lb/>Despite the dislikes reported, 108 respondents <lb/>87 per cent) indicated that they were fairly or <lb/>rery satisfied with their remedy, which is fairly <lb/>meassuring from a pharmacist&apos;s viewpoint. <lb/>Zonclusions <lb/>rhis study has provided information about how <lb/>Jatients perceive their hay fever symptoms and <lb/>low they used six leading OTC hay fever reme-<lb/>iies. The pharmacists&apos; recommendation had the <lb/>;reatest influence on patient choice of a particu-<lb/>ar product. Overall, most patients were satis-<lb/>ied with their remedy. A desired &quot;ideal&quot; hay <lb/>kver remedy would be fast-acting, give long last-<lb/>ng relief and not cause drowsiness. <lb/>The study also clearly demonstrated that the <lb/>:ommunity pharmacy provides a suitable envi-<lb/>&apos;onment for this type of research and that suc-<lb/>:esshl recruitment of patients and collection of <lb/>lata is possible. <lb/>KKNOWLEDGMENTS: We would like to ac-<lb/>:nowledge the financial support of Procter and Gam-<lb/>ble (H&amp;BC) Ltd for this study.
