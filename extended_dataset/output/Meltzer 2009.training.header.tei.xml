	<div type="abstract">Allergic rhinitis (AR), a chronic inflammatory disease of the<lb/> upper airway, is one of the most common chronic diseases in the<lb/> United States and is estimated to affect up to 60 million people.<lb/> Pediatric Allergies in America is the largest and most<lb/> comprehensive survey to date of pediatric patients and parents of<lb/> patients with allergy, as well as health care providers (HCPs),<lb/> regarding AR in children and its treatment. The goals of the<lb/> survey were to determine the prevalence of AR in the US<lb/> pediatric population and to collect information on what effect the<lb/> condition has on patients in terms of symptom burden, quality of<lb/> life, productivity, disease management, and pharmacologic<lb/> treatment. This national survey screened 35,757 households to<lb/> identify 500 children with HCP-diagnosed nasal allergies and 504<lb/> children without nasal allergies who were between the ages of 4<lb/> and 17 years. Parents of young children, as well as children 10 to<lb/> 17 years of age, were questioned about the condition and its<lb/> treatment. In parallel, 501 HCPs were interviewed. This survey<lb/> has captured previously unavailable data on the prevalence of<lb/> nasal allergies and their most common and most bothersome<lb/> symptoms, on the effect of nasal allergies on the quality of life of<lb/> children, and on medication use, including both over-the-counter<lb/> and prescription medications, and has identified factors affecting<lb/> satisfaction with treatment. The Pediatric Allergies in America<lb/> survey also identifies distinct areas for improvement in the<lb/> management of AR in children. In fact, based on the results of this<lb/> survey, it appears that HCPs overestimate patients&apos; and parents&apos;<lb/> satisfaction with disease management and the benefit of<lb/> medications used for the treatment of nasal allergies in children.<lb/> Findings from this national survey have identified important<lb/> challenges to the management of AR, suggesting that its burden<lb/> on children in the United States has been significantly<lb/> underestimated.</div>

	<div type="abstract">Dr Gordon has no relevant business, patent, or stock ownership issues. None of these<lb/> relationships represent any material or significant conflict of interest to his<lb/> participation in the Pediatric Allergies in America study. K. K. Sheth is a consultant<lb/> for Alcon, GlaxoSmithKline, Nycomed, is a member of the speakers bureau for<lb/> Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline, and serves on a committee for the American<lb/> College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology. A. L. Simmons is an advisory board con-<lb/>sultant for Nycomed, and is an advisory board consultant on the speakers&apos; bureau for<lb/> GlaxoSmithKline. M. A. Wingertzahn is employed by Nycomed. J. M. Boyle is<lb/> Executive Vice President of Abt SRBI, which conducted the survey under a contract<lb/> from HealthStar Communications. Abt SRBI also had a contract from ProEd Commu-<lb/>nications for additional analyses after the HealthStar contract was completed.<lb/> Disclosure of sponsor involvement: In any sponsored investigation the issue of bias is<lb/> invariably of concern for the pharmaceutical company and the authors, as well as for<lb/> the journal&apos;s reviewers and readers. During the conduct of this study, much effort was<lb/> made to mitigate potential bias, and safeguards were put in place to limit the sponsor&apos;s<lb/> participation. The Pediatric Allergies in America survey was designed by a panel of<lb/> experts within the allergy and ear, nose, and throat specialties. The sponsor had<lb/> negligible input during these meetings, except for stating that it had hoped the project<lb/> would study the current magnitude of the prevalence and burden of nasal allergies. This<lb/> limited sponsor involvement was not an attempt to shape or otherwise influence the<lb/> direction or outcome of the survey. The survey questions, in concert with the expert<lb/> panel, were written by and administered through Abt SRBI, a respected global strategy,<lb/> public policy, and opinion polling organization that has as clients multiple Fortune 500<lb/> companies; federal, state, and local governments; foundations; and universities. Data<lb/> from the survey were not revealed to the sponsor before a follow-up meeting that was<lb/> held with the clinician advisory committee, thus further minimizing any risk of sponsor<lb/> bias of the data. Finally, the authorship includes only 1 person from the sponsoring<lb/> company, Dr Wingertzahn, a PhD within their clinical development department. Dr<lb/> Wingertzahn has a solid foundation in ethical research and has authored numerous<lb/> manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals within the area of allergy. He was not a member<lb/> of the core writing committee but was a reviewer of the supplement. We believe that<lb/> pharmaceutical companies, no less than clinicians, are appropriately interested in<lb/> learning as much as possible about the needs of their market and patients.<lb/></div>
