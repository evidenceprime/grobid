			<p>that address the underlying cause of the disease and do<lb/> not necessarily take into consideration palliative issues.<lb/> Current therapeutic approaches for the treatment of AR<lb/> include antihistamines, decongestants, leukotriene mod-<lb/>ifiers, and intranasal corticosteroids (INCS). Although<lb/> oral antihistamines are an effective first-line pharmaco-<lb/>logic treatment for intermittent or mild persistent AR,<lb/> they do not adequately address the underlying compo-<lb/>nent of the disease, viz., inflammation. Moreover, sedat-<lb/>ing antihistamines can have deleterious side effects in-<lb/>cluding sedation, impaired cognitive function, and<lb/> cardiac arrhythmias. <ref type="biblio">12-14</ref> INCS, by contrast, are regarded<lb/> as the most effective first-line therapy for patients with<lb/> moderate to severe AR because they reduce localized<lb/> inflammation within the nasal mucosa, thereby eliminat-<lb/>ing the underlying inflammatory cause of the dis-<lb/>ease. 9,<ref type="biblio">15,16</ref> Interestingly, however, data suggest that pa-<lb/>tients may not be satisfied with these agents because of,<lb/> in large part, perceived efficacy and safety concerns in<lb/> addition to undesirable side effects that lead to poor<lb/> medication adherence and compliance. <ref type="biblio">17-21</ref> Concern<lb/> about adverse events and limited knowledge regarding<lb/> international guidelines for rhinitis management may, in<lb/> part, explain why primary care physicians and pediatri-<lb/>cians prescribe unusually low volumes of INCS agents in<lb/> LA. <ref type="biblio">22</ref> Although several large-scale studies and surveys<lb/> (e.g., Allergies in America survey), have attempted to<lb/> ascertain the true prevalence of nasal allergies (NAs), its<lb/> impact on quality of life and current treatment gaps<lb/> within the United States and European Union, <ref type="biblio">6,18,23,24</ref> no<lb/> such studies or surveys have addressed the true burden<lb/> of NAs in LA. Therefore, the Allergies in Latin America<lb/> survey was undertaken in an attempt to further clarify<lb/> the prevalence of physician-diagnosed NAs, its impact on<lb/> quality of life, existing treatment paradigms and treat-<lb/>ment gaps associated with NAs, and the medications<lb/> currently used to treat this disease.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/> Allergies in Latin America Survey<lb/></head>

			<p>Persons targeted for this survey included children and<lb/> adolescents between the ages of 4 and 18 years as well as<lb/> adults aged Ն18 years old residing in one of eight Latin<lb/> American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,<lb/> Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela) who were cur-<lb/>rently experiencing or being treated for NAs after having<lb/> been diagnosed by a physician as having AR or NAs. A<lb/> total of 457 interviews were completed with parents of<lb/> NA sufferers 4 -18 years of age and a total of 1088 inter-<lb/>views were completed with adults having current NAs<lb/> across the eight countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Fieldwork was conducted between February and April<lb/> of 2008 and during which both telephone and in-person<lb/> interviews were conducted. Most of the interviews were<lb/> completed in urban areas because of the low telephone<lb/> penetration and lack of interviewing infrastructure in the<lb/> rural areas of LA. The average interview length was 41<lb/> minutes. The survey was developed and conducted by<lb/> ABT SRBI, an international survey research organization.<lb/> The survey sponsor was NYCOMED, a research-based<lb/> pharmaceutical company.<lb/></p>

			<p>The maximum expected sampling error for a simple<lb/> random sample of 1088 cases (e.g., the adult Latin Amer-<lb/>ican sample) would be ϩ3.0 percentage points at the 95%<lb/> confidence level. The maximum expected sampling error<lb/> for a simple random sample of 457 cases (e.g., the pedi-<lb/>atric Latin American sample) would be ϩ4.6 percentage<lb/> points at the 95% confidence level. The maximum ex-<lb/>pected sampling error for a simple random sample for<lb/> country-specific samples from the Latin American survey<lb/> would be ϩ5.7 percentage points for sample sizes of 300,<lb/> ϩ9.8 percentage points for sample sizes of 100, and ϩ13.9<lb/> percentage points for sample sizes of 50, at the 95%<lb/> confidence level. It should be noted that household sam-<lb/>pling for face-to-face interviews is conducted in a more<lb/> complex design using cluster sampling so design effects<lb/> may increase actual sampling variance compared with<lb/> simple random sampling.<lb/></p>

			<p>A high-level overview of the study design and<lb/> breakdown of the number of households screened<lb/> and surveyed can be found in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> for the adults<lb/> and Table <ref type="table">2</ref> for children and adolescents. It is im-<lb/>portant to note that the population surveyed and<lb/> presented in these two tables was diagnosed with<lb/> AR or NA by a physician.<lb/></p>

			<head>Development of Survey Questionnaires<lb/></head>

			<p>Because validated and standardized questionnaires<lb/> specific to ascertaining the prevalence, impact, and<lb/> treatment gaps associated with NAs did not exist at the<lb/> time of the survey, the research firm Schulman, Ronca,<lb/> and Bucuvalas, Inc., along with expert physicians in<lb/> the AR field from LA collaborated to develop patient<lb/> and health care professional questionnaires that would<lb/> accurately collect relevant information on NAs within<lb/> the Latin American Countries surveyed. Survey ques-<lb/>tions were developed through analysis of relevant lit-<lb/>erature, identification of questions used to study sim-<lb/>ilar diseases in accepted health surveys, and review of<lb/> pertinent questions developed for two previous stud-<lb/>ies supported by NYCOMED. <ref type="biblio">4,25</ref> The developed ques-<lb/>tionnaires focused on general health, NA triggers, NA<lb/> symptoms, effects of allergies on quality of life, NA<lb/> medications, their effectiveness, and side effects.<lb/></p>

			<p>AR questionnaires were reviewed, edited, and ap-<lb/>proved by a panel of AR experts. Weights were devel-<lb/>oped to correct for sampling bias and differences be-<lb/>tween eligible patients screened and eligible patients<lb/> actually interviewed. An age and gender correction<lb/> ensured that the interviewed population was similar to<lb/></p>

			<p>The major demographic characteristics captured<lb/> from survey participants are displayed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>There was approximately a 2:1 ratio of females versus<lb/> males surveyed. The majority of respondents had some<lb/> schooling with the majority having education up<lb/> through the secondary level. There were slightly more<lb/> respondents who cited having only public insurance<lb/> versus those who cited having private insurance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Prevalence of AR or NAs Diagnosed by Physicians<lb/> in LA<lb/></head>

Among<lb/> Latin American countries surveyed, Peru and Venezu-<lb/>ela reported the highest prevalence of NAs and Argen-<lb/>tina reported the lowest prevalence of diagnosed NAs.<lb/> A complete breakdown of the prevalence of AR across<lb/> the eight countries can be found in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>A large majority of adults with diagnosed NAs<lb/> across all eight countries reported having seasonal or<lb/> intermittent NAs rather than NAs occurring through-<lb/>out the year. Adults with NAs in Peru reported the<lb/> highest rate of seasonal allergies whereas Ecuador re-<lb/>ported the lowest rate of seasonal allergies. The reason<lb/> for the low rate to seasonal allergies in Ecuador is<lb/> likely ascribed to the minimal seasonal variation in this<lb/> region.<lb/></p>

			<p>Equally, the majority of parents of children and ad-<lb/>olescents with NAs across all eight countries reported<lb/> that their children&apos;s and adolescents NAs were sea-<lb/>sonal or intermittent rather than occurring throughout<lb/> the year. Parents of children and adolescents with NAs<lb/> in Mexico reported the highest rate of seasonal aller-<lb/>gies whereas the parents of children and adolescent&apos;s<lb/> with NAs in Argentina reported the lowest rate of<lb/> seasonal allergies (Fig. <ref type="figure">2, A and B</ref>). Interestingly, de-<lb/>spite nearly two-thirds of respondents stating that their<lb/> allergies were seasonal or intermittent in nature, the<lb/> major allergy trigger reported by survey participants<lb/> was dust, a typical perennial allergen due to the high<lb/> level of mite-related antigens (73% of adults and 74%<lb/> of children and adolescents surveyed).<lb/></p>

			<p>With regard to diagnosis of disease, the majority of<lb/> adult survey respondents reported having been diag-<lb/>nosed with NAs by their general practice physician<lb/> (37%) or an otolaryngologist (29%). Other physicians<lb/> making the first diagnosis of NAs included allergists<lb/> (13%), pediatricians (6%), pulmonologists (4%), family<lb/> practice physicians (2%), internists (1%), dermatolo-<lb/>gists (1%), and others (7%). A similar pattern was<lb/> observed in the child respondents (20% diagnosed by<lb/> their general practice physician and 20% having been<lb/> diagnosed by their otolaryngologist). The majority of<lb/> individuals who were surveyed reported that they had<lb/> the diagnosis of NA confirmed by a skin-prick test, a<lb/> blood test, or both (57% of adults and 61% of children<lb/> and adolescents surveyed).<lb/></p>

			<p>When survey participants were asked to rate their<lb/> general health and other concomitant conditions, 31%<lb/> adult participants and 33% of pediatric participants<lb/> reported an overall health rating of poor to fair or poor.<lb/> When asked about other concomitant medical condi-<lb/>tions, essentially one-quarter of adults, adolescents,<lb/> and children included in the survey reported having<lb/> been diagnosed with asthma. Adult participants were<lb/> also asked what concomitant conditions they experi-<lb/>enced within the past 4 weeks after a NA exacerbation.<lb/> Nearly 50% reported suffering from the cold or flu<lb/> (47%) followed closely by migraine headaches (41%).<lb/> Over one-third reported having sinusitis or gastro-<lb/>esophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related symptoms<lb/> (33 and 30%, respectively). The most frequently occur-<lb/>ring concomitant conditions in adolescents and chil-<lb/>dren, like in the adults, were cold or flu (52%) followed<lb/> by migraine headaches (31%). Sinusitis and GERD-<lb/>related symptoms were reported less frequently in<lb/> children and adolescents compared with adults (26%<lb/> versus 33% and 30% versus 13%, respectively). A com-<lb/>plete breakdown of the most frequently occurring<lb/> health-related conditions during or after an NA exac-<lb/>erbation reported in adults, children, and adolescents<lb/> with NAs are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">3, A and B</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Symptoms Associated with AR and NAs in Latin<lb/> American Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>Adults with NAs in LA were asked about the fre-<lb/>quency with which they experienced specific symp-<lb/>toms. Overall, more than one-half of them reported<lb/> that they experienced nasal congestion every day or<lb/> most days when their NAs were most severe. Addi-<lb/>tionally, nearly one-half reported nasal itching (49%)<lb/> and repeated sneezing (47%) on all or most days in<lb/> their worst month. A similar pattern emerged in chil-<lb/>dren and adolescents with NAs. A full descriptive<lb/> breakdown of the most bothersome symptoms re-<lb/>ported by children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed<lb/> with NAs are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">4, A and B</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Quality-of-Life Impact of AR and NAs in Latin<lb/> American Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>The Allergies in Latin America survey also assessed<lb/> the impact of NA symptoms on quality of life. Almost<lb/> all patients with NAs reported that the condition had<lb/> an impact on their daily life when NA was at its worst.<lb/> To this end, one-half of the adults surveyed reported<lb/> that NAs affected their lives to at least a moderate<lb/> degree. Similarly, almost all parents of children and<lb/> adolescents with NAs reported that the disease had<lb/> some impact on their child&apos;s daily life when symptoms<lb/> were most severe. Forty-one percent of children and<lb/> adolescents reported having their daily life impacted to<lb/> at least a moderate degree when their NAs were at<lb/> their worst.<lb/></p>

			<p>When adults were asked to identify specifically how<lb/> NAs impacted their daily activities, they reported they<lb/> were limited to some degree in having pets; exercising;<lb/> and engaging in social, family, and outdoor activities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Copyright (c) Oceanside Publications, Inc. All rights reserved.<lb/> For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm<lb/> When adults of children and adolescents with NAs<lb/> were asked about activity limitations resulting specif-<lb/>ically from their child&apos;s NAs, they reported that their<lb/> children and adolescents were limited in playing<lb/> sports, outdoor activities, having pets, and going out<lb/> with friends.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is well recognized that NAs can affect a patient&apos;s<lb/> sleep quality. As such, the Allergies in Latin America<lb/> survey attempted to quantify sleep impact among NA<lb/> patients. In the adult portion of the survey, 44% of<lb/> sufferers reported being greatly troubled by at least<lb/> one sleep indicator (e.g., falling asleep, awakening dur-<lb/>ing the night, and perception of lack of restful night<lb/> sleep). Similarly, 45% of children and adolescents suf-<lb/>fering from NAs reported being greatly troubled by at<lb/> least one of the aforementioned sleep indicators.<lb/></p>

			<p>Aside from physical symptoms, NAs can affect the<lb/> mood and feelings of those that suffer from them.<lb/> Fatigue associated with NAs was reported as the most<lb/> frequent mood disorder followed closely by irritability.<lb/> Depression was the third most frequent mood disorder<lb/> experienced by adult allergy sufferers in LA (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).<lb/> Likewise, in children and adolescents, fatigue due to<lb/> NA was the most frequently experienced mood disor-<lb/>der, followed by frequent irritability and frequent de-<lb/>pression (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>One important way in which NAs can impact an<lb/> individual&apos;s daily life is the degree to which it can<lb/> interfere with allergy sufferers&apos; ability to work. Nearly<lb/> two of five (37%) adults with NAs in LA reported<lb/> having missed work or having their job performance<lb/> affected by their NAs in the past 12 months (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).<lb/> When survey participants were asked to rate their<lb/> work productivity with and without allergy symp-<lb/>toms, adults reported their mean work productivity<lb/> when experiencing severe NAs was reduced by one-<lb/>third compared with when they experienced no symp-<lb/>toms (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Interestingly, these results were highly<lb/> concordant across all countries surveyed in that re-<lb/>spondents in the individual countries consistently re-<lb/>ported at least a 30 percentage point difference in their<lb/> work productivity when experiencing NAs at their<lb/> worst compared with when they were symptom free.<lb/> By contrast, over one-half of the parents of children<lb/> and adolescents with NAs in LA reported that their<lb/> adolescents and children had missed school or had<lb/> their school performance affected by their NAs in the<lb/> past 12 months (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Similar to the adults with NAs,<lb/> parents of children and adolescents with NAs in LA<lb/> cited a one-third loss in school productivity when their<lb/> child&apos;s NAs were at their worst compared with when<lb/> they were symptom free (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Need for Treatment of AR and NA Symptoms and<lb/> Current Treatment Gaps<lb/></head>

			<p>Most NA sufferers in LA are taking some kind of<lb/> medication for their condition. Nearly one-half of<lb/> adults with NAs reported using over-the-counter<lb/> (OTC) medications for their allergies and a nearly iden-<lb/>tical number reported taking some type of prescription<lb/> NA medication within the past 4 weeks. Only one in<lb/> four reported using a prescription nasal spray to con-<lb/>trol their NA symptoms in the past 4 weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure">7 A</ref>).<lb/> Interestingly, although most children and adolescents<lb/> with NAs in LA were taking some kind of medication<lb/> for their condition, the difference between OTC use<lb/> and prescription use varied considerably compared<lb/> with the adult population. Specifically, 25% of children<lb/> and adolescents with NAs were reported to be using<lb/></p>

All rights reserved.<lb/> For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm<lb/> OTC medications whereas 51% reported using some<lb/> type of prescription medication for their NAs in the<lb/> past 4 weeks and 30% reported using a prescription<lb/> nasal spray to control their NA symptoms in the past 4<lb/> weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure">7 B</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Adults with NAs were also asked about the fre-<lb/>quency with which they change their NA medication.<lb/> The overwhelming majority stated that they rarely, if<lb/> ever, change their NA medications once they started<lb/> taking the medication (79%). A similar percentage of<lb/> parents of children and adolescents with NAs reported<lb/> rarely, if ever, changing their children&apos;s and adoles-<lb/>cents&apos; NA medications (76%). Interestingly, Ecuador<lb/> reported the highest percentage (21%) of adults who<lb/> change their medicine several times a year. Those NA<lb/> sufferers in LA who have changed their NA medica-<lb/>tion were asked to specify the reason for changing their<lb/> medication. The most common reason for changing<lb/> medications was that the medication was not ade-<lb/>quately effective (39%). The second most common rea-<lb/>son was because their doctor wanted to try something<lb/> else (23%). A similar pattern emerged when parents of<lb/> children and adolescents with NAs were surveyed.<lb/> Interestingly, in both populations, cost and issues<lb/> around cost were not a major reason for switching NA<lb/> medications.<lb/></p>

Types of medications used by (A) Latin American adults and (B) Latin American children and adolescents with allergic rhinitis to treat nasal<lb/> allergies.<lb/> S16<lb/> May-June 2010, Vol. 31, No. 3 (Suppl 1)<lb/> D O<lb/> N O<lb/> T<lb/> C O<lb/> P Y<lb/> Delivered by Ingenta to: Guest User IP: 91.238.82.168 On: Fri, 15 Jul 2016 11:41:42<lb/> Copyright (c) Oceanside Publications, Inc.

			<p>The issue of dissatisfaction with NA medications was<lb/> also addressed in this survey. Adults reported lack of<lb/> effectiveness (67%), effectiveness wearing off with<lb/> chronic use (16%), lack of 24-hour relief (13%), and<lb/> bothersome side effects (12%) as the most common<lb/> reasons for dissatisfaction. A similar pattern emerged<lb/> with children and adolescents in that 67% of parents<lb/> cited poor effectiveness as a reason for dissatisfaction<lb/> followed by lack of 24-hour relief (26%), effectiveness<lb/> wearing off with chronic use (19%), and bothersome<lb/> side effects (13%).<lb/></p>

			<head>Treatment Paradigms and Treatment Gaps with<lb/> Prescription Nasal Sprays<lb/></head>

			<p>Because prescription nasal sprays, especially cortico-<lb/>steroid sprays, are considered the most effective agents<lb/> available to treat NAs, the survey focused on current<lb/> treatment paradigms as well as treatment gaps with<lb/> these agents. As previously discussed, 25% of adults<lb/> and 30% of parents of children and adolescents with<lb/> NAs reported taking some kind of prescription NA<lb/> medication within the last 4 weeks. When adult survey<lb/> participants were asked why they had not taken a<lb/> prescription nasal spray for their NAs the majority<lb/> responded that they did not take a prescription nasal<lb/> spray because they did not have any symptoms (26%).<lb/> Other responses in descending order of frequency<lb/> were physician never prescribed this type of medica-<lb/>tion (22%), do not like nasal sprays (14%), and lack of<lb/> severe enough symptoms (13%).<lb/></p>

			<p>When asked about the relief experienced with pre-<lb/>scription nasal sprays, two-thirds of adults with NA<lb/> reported that their prescription nasal spray gave them<lb/> relief from all or most of their NA symptoms. By<lb/> contrast, only a small minority (3%) reported that they<lb/> received no relief whatsoever after taking their pre-<lb/>scription nasal spray. A similar pattern emerged with<lb/> adults of children and adolescents with NA (data not<lb/> shown).<lb/></p>

			<p>Because efficacy appeared to be the main driver in<lb/> patient dissatisfaction, the Allergies in Latin America<lb/> survey attempted to elucidate the concerns related to<lb/> efficacy as it specifically pertained to prescription nasal<lb/> sprays. When adult prescription nasal spray users<lb/> were asked whether their spray provided adequate<lb/> 24-hour relief, over one-third (35%) of adult users re-<lb/>ported that their current prescription nasal spray lost<lb/> effectiveness over the course of the day and night.<lb/> Interestingly, in Ecuador the region where prescription<lb/> nasal spray was the lowest, 50% of nasal spray users<lb/> reported that their prescription nasal spray lost effec-<lb/>tiveness over the course of the day also. A similar<lb/> pattern emerged for surveyed parents of children and<lb/> adolescents diagnosed NAs (data not shown).<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to prescription nasal sprays loosing ef-<lb/>fectiveness over the course of the day, the reduction in<lb/> effectiveness with chronic use was also assessed. When<lb/> adult users of prescription nasal sprays were asked<lb/> whether they had ever found the continuing effective-<lb/>ness of their prescription nasal spray wearing off with<lb/> chronic use, nearly one in three (27%) reported having<lb/> experienced diminished effectiveness of their prescrip-<lb/>tion nasal spray when taken over a long period of time.<lb/> A nearly identical pattern emerged in those adults<lb/> surveyed with children and adolescents with NAs.<lb/></p>

Other side effects reported by adult NA suffers<lb/> are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> A.

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>Nasal allergies are generally recognized as the most<lb/> common chronic respiratory disorder worldwide.<lb/> However, prevalence estimates for the adult popula-<lb/>tion suffering from NAs in LA are currently lacking.<lb/> Although one study, the ISAAC, attempted to estimate<lb/> the prevalence of AR in LA, these estimates are limited<lb/> to two age cohorts (6 -7 years and 13-14 years) and are<lb/> based on 12-month prevalence of symptoms re-<lb/>sponded by the patient that suggest allergies by the<lb/> symptoms and not a physician diagnosis as was the<lb/> case in the survey presented here. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> By contrast Allergies<lb/> in Latin America is based on a physician diagnosis of the<lb/> nasal allergies. The Allergies in Latin America survey<lb/> is the first study in the Latin American population<lb/> conducted with the sole purpose of ascertaining the<lb/> prevalence, symptoms, impact, and treatment of NAs<lb/> in children, adolescents, and adults in LA. This study<lb/> has uncovered a substantial negative impact of NAs on<lb/> quality of life and has identified a number of treatment<lb/> paradigms along with and, perhaps more importantly,<lb/> the treatment gaps that currently exist in the treatment<lb/> of this common chronic condition. In addition, it dif-<lb/>fered from the ISAAC survey in that ISSAC is based<lb/> solely on questionnaires, responded to by the patient,<lb/> that suggest allergies by their symptoms. By contrast<lb/> Allergies in Latin America is based on a physician diag-<lb/>nosis of the nasal allergies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Prevalence data in this survey has shown that NA is<lb/> a common and chronic disease in LA as it is elsewhere<lb/> in the world. <ref type="biblio">26</ref> The overall prevalence of diagnosed<lb/> NAs obtained from this survey was on average 6.6%<lb/> across all eight Latin American countries surveyed.<lb/> Interestingly and unexpectedly, this prevalence data<lb/> was substantially lower than that published in the<lb/></p>

All rights reserved.<lb/> For permission to copy go to https://www.oceansidepubl.com/permission.htm<lb/> ISAAC study in which the total prevalence was 27.9<lb/> and 37.6% for the 6-to 7-year-old group and the 13-to<lb/> 14-year-old group, respectively, in the last 12 months.<lb/> Additionally, these data also were substantially lower<lb/> when compared with their prevalence in North Amer-<lb/>ica (14% in the United States and 20% in Canada,<lb/> respectively), when using the same criteria of a physi-<lb/>cian diagnosis of AR or NAs as a clinical validation of<lb/> the self-reported health condition. <ref type="biblio">6,27</ref> By these criteria,<lb/> those respondents who mentioned that they had NAs<lb/> or AR but chose to self-treat rather than see a physi-<lb/>cian, because of the cost of a physician visit, were not<lb/> included in the overall prevalence estimates. Hence, it<lb/> is important to recognize that these apparent discor-<lb/>dant prevalence estimates do not necessarily mean that<lb/> NAs are less common in LA, but rather that the rates of<lb/> physician diagnosis of the condition are likely different<lb/> or that the level of subdiagnoses of AR is high in Latin<lb/> American countries in comparison with the United<lb/> States and Canada. It is important mention that the<lb/> social economics status, insurance types, and health<lb/> care availability varies significantly across the different<lb/> countries of LA. As such, it is not without reason to<lb/> conclude that this could, in part, provide a rationale for<lb/> the variations in NA prevalence among countries<lb/> within LA. However, in the authors, opinions these<lb/> differences are unlikely to be the major factor driving<lb/> the varying prevalence estimates across the various<lb/> Latin American countries surveyed. Rather, the socio-<lb/>economic differences are likely a direct driver of the<lb/> differences between OTC and prescription NA use<lb/> across the different countries as outlined later in this<lb/> Discussion.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite the comparatively low prevalence of physi-<lb/>cian-diagnosed NAs within LA compared with else-<lb/>where in the world, reassuringly, the types of symp-<lb/>toms experienced by NA suffers as well as the impact<lb/> on their daily lives was highly concordant with other<lb/> studies reporting the impact on quality of life and<lb/> treatment gaps that currently exist in the treatment of<lb/> NAs. For example, the most bothersome symptoms<lb/> reported by NA suffers within LA included nasal con-<lb/>gestion, runny nose, postnasal drip, itching eyes, head-<lb/>aches, watering eyes, and repeated sneezing. These<lb/> most bothersome symptoms, especially nasal conges-<lb/>tion, were consistent with those reported by individu-<lb/>als in other studies. <ref type="biblio">1,9,22,24<lb/></ref> It is well established that NA has a profound impact on<lb/> the sufferer&apos;s quality of life. Not only do people with NAs<lb/> complain of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, itch-<lb/>ing, and associated eye problems, but they also have<lb/> impaired emotional well-being and social functioning. <ref type="biblio">6<lb/></ref> Additionally, data have shown that nasal congestion, the<lb/> most prominent (and bothersome according to this sur-<lb/>vey) symptom in NAs, is associated with sleep-disor-<lb/>dered breathing. <ref type="biblio">28</ref> Sleep-disordered breathing secondary<lb/> to NA has been shown to have a profound effect on<lb/> mental health, including increased psychiatric disorders,<lb/> depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse. <ref type="biblio">6,10,11,29,30</ref> Further-<lb/>more, sleep-disordered breathing in childhood and ado-<lb/>lescence is associated with increased disorders of learning<lb/> performance, behavior, and attention. <ref type="biblio">31</ref> The data pre-<lb/>sented here are also concordant with data published by<lb/> others. These data have shown that almost all patients<lb/> with NAs reported that the condition had some impact<lb/> on their daily lives. Additionally, the most common<lb/></p>

			<p>Sleep impairment is a significant problem for patients<lb/> with inflammatory disorders of the upper respiratory<lb/> tract, such as NA, rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis.<lb/> Nasal congestion, one of the most common and bother-<lb/>some symptoms of these disorders, is associated with<lb/> sleep-disordered breathing and is thought to be a key<lb/> cause of sleep impairment. <ref type="biblio">32</ref> Although the literature is<lb/> replete with data linking NA with impaired sleep, the<lb/> negative impact on sleep quality and quantity and, con-<lb/>sequently, on various aspects of the patient&apos;s life, remains<lb/> an underrecognized and undertreated component of NA<lb/> morbidity. <ref type="biblio">1,32-40</ref> The data from the current survey show<lb/> that nearly one-half of children, adolescents, and adults<lb/> with NAs had reported either difficulty in falling asleep,<lb/> awakening during the night, or the lack of a restful<lb/> night&apos;s sleep.<lb/></p>

			<p>The frequent and burdensome symptoms of NA as<lb/> well impaired sleep can significantly affect allergy suffer-<lb/>ers&apos; lives and work productivity. The two primary com-<lb/>ponents of work productivity are absenteeism and pre-<lb/>senteeism. Absenteeism represents the number of days/<lb/> hours missed from work because of the illness, whereas<lb/> presenteeism refers to illness-related reductions in per-<lb/>formance while the person is at work. Although NA does<lb/> not contribute to a large extent to absenteeism in the<lb/> workplace or school, it does have a large impact on<lb/> presenteeism. <ref type="biblio">6,40,41</ref> According to data from the Allergies<lb/> in Latin America survey presented here, employed pa-<lb/>tients with NA have their productivity falling by over<lb/> 33% on average between days when they have no allergy<lb/> symptoms and days when their allergy symptoms are at<lb/> their worst. A similar pattern emerges when parents<lb/> were asked to rate their children&apos;s and adolescent&apos;s pro-<lb/>ductivity in school. Interestingly, these data were consis-<lb/>tent with the data from the Allergies in America survey,<lb/> which showed a 23% reduction in adult productivity, and<lb/> a 30% decrease in productivity in children. <ref type="biblio">6,25</ref> Addition-<lb/>ally, these data underscore the significant degree to<lb/> which NA can impact work performance as well as the<lb/> large, but hitherto unmeasured, economic consequences<lb/> of NAs in LA.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to examining the prevalence, symptoms,<lb/> and burden of NAs in LA, the current survey also ad-<lb/>dressed the role of NA medications in the treatment of<lb/> NAs, including patient perspectives on both the effective-<lb/>ness and the bothersome side effects associated with<lb/> these medications. Almost all NA sufferers said that dis-<lb/>comfort during an allergy attack could not be ignored,<lb/> with 53% of patients stating that the discomfort is some-<lb/>thing that they can not tolerate without relief. Relief is<lb/> sought through prescription and OTC medications. The<lb/> majority of adult patients (67%) have used some medica-<lb/>tion for their NAs in the past 12 months, with nearly an<lb/> identical split between OTC and prescription agents.<lb/> There was nearly a 2:1 ratio of children and adolescents<lb/> receiving prescription versus OTC medications to treat<lb/> their disease. Interestingly, only one in four adult patients<lb/> and one in three children and adolescents used a pre-<lb/>scription nasal spray within the past 12 months within<lb/> LA. Surprisingly, despite the differences in health care<lb/> system and insurance coverage between LA and the<lb/> United States, the pattern of prescription versus OTC<lb/> medication use was surprisingly similar with 50% of<lb/> adults in the Allergy in America survey reporting that<lb/> they had used some type of OTC medication and 45%<lb/> reporting some type of prescription use within the past 12<lb/> months. It is important to note, however, that appreciably<lb/> more patients in the United States reported taking a pre-<lb/>scription nasal spray (36%) compared with survey re-<lb/>spondents in LA (24%). The reasons for not taking a<lb/> prescription NA sprays were in part related to their dis-<lb/>satisfaction with related sensory attributes as well as the<lb/> fact that they only perceive the need for a prescription<lb/> nasal spray in the most serious of cases and mild-to-<lb/>moderate disease is not perceived to require such potent<lb/> agents, as well as the fact that primary care physicians<lb/> and pediatricians within LA typically use oral antihista-<lb/>mine with decongestants to manage the nasal blockage<lb/> instead of using nasal INCS as the Allergic Rhinitis and<lb/> its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) recommends. <ref type="biblio">22</ref> One other<lb/> reason that could explain the differences in OTC versus<lb/> prescription NA use in LA could be related to the socio-<lb/>economic differences and insurance coverage among in-<lb/>dividuals across the various Latin American countries<lb/> surveyed. It is worthy of mention that nasal antihista-<lb/>mine use was essentially not reported in this survey<lb/> because of the fact that these agents are not readily avail-<lb/>able in LA. Therefore, it is not without reason to conclude<lb/> that if these agents were readily available and accepted in<lb/> LA, the prescription uses may well have increased.<lb/></p>

			<p>Treatment gaps were also addressed with current NA<lb/> therapies in LA. These data showed that patients rarely, if<lb/> ever, changed allergy medications once they were pre-<lb/>scribed them. However, among those that did change<lb/> NA medications, the major reason cited for changing<lb/> their medication was related to lack of efficacy. When we<lb/> looked specifically at the prescription nasal spray seg-<lb/>ment, the lack of efficacy was specifically related to lack<lb/> of 24-hour control of symptoms as well as diminution of<lb/> effect with chronic use. These results were very similar to<lb/> the results in the Allergies in America survey in which<lb/> 37% of those participants reporting dissatisfaction with<lb/> NA medications cited they were dissatisfied due to lack<lb/> of adequate effectiveness. <ref type="biblio">42<lb/></ref> Another driver of dissatisfaction with NA medications,<lb/> specifically prescription nasal sprays, was unpleasant<lb/> side effects. When the types of side effects experienced<lb/> with prescription nasal sprays were assessed, the major-<lb/>ity of users reported bad taste and retrograde drainage<lb/></p>

These data were concordant with<lb/> the data obtained in the Allergies in America survey as<lb/> well as other studies that looked at sensory attributes that<lb/> patients found unpleasant. In one study by Mahedevia<lb/> and colleagues, sensory attributes of INCS sprays were<lb/> evaluated to assess which attributes influence patients&apos;<lb/> willingness to adhere to therapy. They found that lack of<lb/> aftertaste was the most important attribute, followed by<lb/> aftertaste, throat rundown, and nose runout. <ref type="biblio">20</ref> These data<lb/> suggest that patient preference may be an important<lb/> driver in increasing patient acceptance and adherence to<lb/> NA medications.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, a better understanding of the true<lb/> burden of NAs and NAs by physicians and patients in<lb/> addition to better education of patients about their<lb/> condition and treatment options is an important step in<lb/> any medical treatment regimen. Thus, the information<lb/> obtained from the Allergies in Latin America survey<lb/> pertaining to prevalence, impact on quality of life, and<lb/> treatment gaps now enable physicians within LA to<lb/> better describe the true burden of disease to patients,<lb/> which should lead to better patient education and,<lb/> ultimately, to better treatment outcomes for sufferers<lb/> of NAs and AR.<lb/></p>
