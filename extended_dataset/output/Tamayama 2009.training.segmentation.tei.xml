High mor-<lb/>bidity raises a concern about its impact on health care resources. Utility weights, which are required for cost-<lb/>utility analysis by the level of severity, have not been established to date. This study aims to derive the weights <lb/>based on a community survey with a time trade-off technique. <lb/>Methods: Self-administered monthly time trade-off questionnaires were administered to representative sam-<lb/>ples in the community. Four levels of severity were defined by clinical stratification proposed in the &quot;Practical <lb/>Guideline for the Management of Allergic Rhinitis in Japan&quot;. <lb/>Results: 146 responses (response rate: 51.0%) were collected. Utility weights by the four levels of severity <lb/>were found to be 0.96, 0.94, 0.89 and 0.83, from mild to severest symptoms, respectively. These values were <lb/>found to be statistically independent from the respondent&apos;s characteristics such as sex, age, existence of cur-<lb/>rent nasal symptoms or history of allergic rhinitis. <lb/>Conclusions: The authors consider that the elicited utility weights are reliable. The results of this study could <lb/>facilitate economic evaluations regarding allergic rhinitis in various contexts, contributing to better management <lb/>of the disease. <lb/>KEY WORDS <lb/>pollinosis, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, quality of life, seasonal allergic rhinitis, utility theory <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Allergic rhinitis has been recognised as a burden to <lb/>both health care systems and society in Europe 1 and <lb/>the U.S. 2 18.7% of Europeans 3 and 9.9-16% of Ameri-<lb/>cans 4 are estimated to be suffering from the disease. <lb/>This is similar in Japan as well. Allergic rhinitis in a <lb/>form of cedar pollinosis is one of the most common <lb/>illnesses, of which prevalence is estimated to be as <lb/>high as 19.7% of the nation. 5 This means one in five <lb/>Japanese suffers allergic symptoms from winter to <lb/>spring every year, during which cedar pollens scatter <lb/>in the air. Other seasonal rhinitis caused by various <lb/>allergens and perennial allergic rhinitis also affect the <lb/>nation. 6 Allergic rhinitis is not a fatal disease, but its <lb/>symptoms such as sneezing, itchy eyes or stuffy nose <lb/>deteriorate the quality of life (QOL). <lb/>The Practical Guideline for the Management of Al-<lb/>lergic Rhinitis in Japan 6 was published by an expert <lb/>committee, in which clinical stratification of allergic <lb/>rhinitis symptoms and severity (Fig. 1) is clearly de-<lb/>fined for the purpose of standardization of practice <lb/>and research. Although the guideline proposes a <lb/>Japanese Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Question-<lb/>naire (JRQLQ) in order to evaluate outcomes in <lb/>terms of QOL, 7 utility weights, which enable out-<lb/>comes evaluation in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life <lb/>Years (QALYs) by the level of severity of symptoms <lb/>have not been established. A utility weight is a value <lb/>from 0 to 1, which is attached to various health stat-<lb/>uses. By combining it with survival time in changing <lb/>health statuses, life expectancy is adjusted into <lb/>QALYs taking QOL into account. For example, one <lb/>year survival suffering from severe symptoms with <lb/></body>

Such a calculation of QALYs with <lb/>utility weights allows a better comparison of out-<lb/>comes of QOL deteriorating disease treatments, and <lb/>it is recommended in conducting economic evalu-<lb/>ation of health care intervention. 8 In Japan, 0.89 for <lb/>seasonal allergic rhinitis and 0.97 for perennial aller-<lb/>gic rhinitis as the average of patients with various lev-<lb/>els of symptoms using EQ-5D 9 only was reported by <lb/>Monden and Ogino (2005) 10 to date. <lb/>This paper aims to derive utility weights for allergic <lb/>rhinitis by the level of the standard clinical stratifica-<lb/>tion of severity. Since high morbidity of cedar pollino-<lb/>sis raises a concern about its impact on health care <lb/>resources in Japan 11,12 and elsewhere, 13,14 the results <lb/>could facilitate economic evaluations using a recom-<lb/>mended outcomes measurement, QALYs, 8 which <lb/>could contribute to more efficient management of the <lb/>disease. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>In deriving utility weights, choosing whose prefer-<lb/>ence is to be elicited is essential. 15 The objective of <lb/>deriving utility weights, that is, its use for cost-utility <lb/>analysis, imposes a gold standard that preference of <lb/>the general public should be elicited. 16 However, util-<lb/>ity weights are sometimes drawn from patients or ex-<lb/>perts in practice, because it is often difficult for <lb/>healthy individuals to have an accurate grasp of their <lb/>health status subjected to a specific disease without <lb/>experience. 17 In the context of this study, &quot;suffering <lb/>from rhinitis&quot; or its symptoms are both common and <lb/>easy to understand, and therefore, we choose to ask <lb/>the preference of representative samples among the <lb/>general public. <lb/>Technically, there are two approaches in eliciting <lb/>preference for health status as utility weights. 18 One <lb/>approach is the use of multi-attribute health status <lb/>classification systems, 19 as Monden and Ogino <lb/>(2005) 9 used EQ-5D, while the other is the use of <lb/>techniques, which directly measure the preference of <lb/>individuals. We choose direct measurement in this <lb/>study, since the former approach is suitable for ques-<lb/>tioning patients. There are three most widely used <lb/>techniques in measuring preferences directly: the rat-<lb/>ing scale and its variants (RS), the standard gamble <lb/>(SG) and the time trade-off (TTO). 18 RS is the easiest <lb/>and quickest to implement, but it is also known as an <lb/>erratic measure. 15 Therefore, RS is often used as an <lb/>introductory or complementary to SG or TTO. Al-<lb/>though theoretical superiority of the SG against TTO <lb/>is established in regards to the axioms of the von <lb/>Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory, 20 TTO is con-<lb/>sistently found much easier to respond to compared <lb/>to SG by respondents. 15 Therefore, the choice be-<lb/>tween them usually depends on the context of the <lb/>study. 18 <lb/>In order to apply these techniques to representa-<lb/>tive samples of the general public, the mode of ques-<lb/>tioning needs to be chosen. It is known that risk or <lb/>probability communication, which is required for SG, <lb/>is better achieved by an interview along a dialogue, 21 <lb/>but recruiting representative interviewees from the <lb/>general public is hard to implement. On the contrary, <lb/></body>

There-<lb/>fore, we choose the TTO complemented by the RS in <lb/>this study. <lb/>There are wide variations in designing a TTO in-<lb/>strument. 23 Conventional lifetime TTO where a re-<lb/>spondent trades against unwanted premature death <lb/>originated from Torrance et al. (1976). 24 The Buck-<lb/>ingham et al. (1996) experiment used two other vari-<lb/>ations: annual TTO where a respondent trades <lb/>against unwanted convalescence, and daily TTO <lb/>where a respondent trades against unwanted sleep in <lb/>a day. The use of daily TTO is most recommended <lb/>among these three, because it produces more consis-<lb/>tent results. 26 <lb/>We constructed our questions for the TTO (Box 1) <lb/>featuring cedar pollinosis instead of allergic rhinitis <lb/>as the disease under consideration, although the de-<lb/>scriptions of health statuses are in accordance with <lb/>the clinical stratification of allergic rhinitis symptoms <lb/>and severity. This is because featured pollinosis is <lb/>more common and therefore it could attract more at-<lb/>tention than stating allergic rhinitis. We devised a <lb/>monthly TTO taking advantage of seasonality that is <lb/>quite well-known to the general public. One month of <lb/>continuous suffering is considered easy to imagine by <lb/>the respondents. In our monthly TTO, the respon-<lb/>dent trades against unwanted sleep in a month. Un-<lb/>wanted sleep metaphor for dead status, which is simi-<lb/>lar to daily TTO employed after pilot testing was ad-<lb/>ministered to several collaborators. <lb/>Every respondent was repeatedly questioned four <lb/>times in order to fill the four separate answer sheets <lb/>(Fig. 2), imagining the sufferings of each severity <lb/>level of symptoms explained in the clinical stratifica-<lb/>tion (Fig. 1). They were asked to check &apos;Yes&apos; or &apos;No&apos; <lb/>regarding medication according to the length of un-<lb/>wanted sleep. The level, at which answer changes <lb/>from &apos;Yes&apos; to &apos;No&apos;, was judged as an indication of the <lb/>point of indifference in the trade-off. Utility weights <lb/>were calculated by the following formula: <lb/>Utility weight ＝ <lb/>30 − Number of acceptable sleeping days <lb/>30 <lb/>The questionnaire starts with a face sheet on the <lb/>characteristics of the respondent, followed by an ex-<lb/>planation of clinical stratification of allergic rhinitis <lb/>symptoms and severity. Then, for each level of sever-<lb/>ity of symptoms, the respondent is asked to rate his! <lb/>her preference from 0 points (dead) to 100 points <lb/>(perfect health) on the visual analogue scale. The RS <lb/>is incorporated before the TTO questions for the pur-<lb/>pose of warm-up and engaging respondents, as well <lb/>as for the comparison with the results by TTO. <lb/>The questionnaire as above was used in our com-<lb/>munity survey, of which samples were selected by <lb/>stratified systematic sampling from the basic resident <lb/>register of Tsukuba city, Ibaraki prefecture in Japan. <lb/>It is an academic and garden city located in the sub-<lb/>urbs of Tokyo. 300 samples in total were selected by <lb/>sex and age stratum of 20-39, 40-59 and 60+. Adults <lb/>of age 20 and over were chosen, since we considered <lb/>that this did not have a serious bias in the representa-<lb/>tiveness of social preference. These sex and age cate-<lb/>gories were set for the purpose of examining the reli-<lb/>ability of results. On the face sheet, existence of cur-<lb/></body>

There were 68 males and 78 females. There <lb/>was no statistically significant difference in the re-<lb/>sponse rate between them by the χ 2 test. 39, 49 and <lb/>58 samples responded in the age strata 20-39, 40-59 <lb/>and 60+, respectively. Here, a statistically significant <lb/>difference in the response rate was found by the χ 2 <lb/>test. The older the age strata, the higher the re-<lb/>sponse rate. 31.5% of respondents reported currently <lb/>experiencing nasal symptoms, while 33.6% reported <lb/>having a past history of cedar pollinosis, of which av-<lb/>erage years of suffering was 12.5 years. A statistical <lb/>association was found between current nasal symp-<lb/>toms and history of cedar pollinosis by the χ 2 test, de-<lb/>spite the survey being conducted during out of cedar <lb/>pollen season. This may be due to the comorbidity of <lb/>perennial allergic rhinitis or pollen allergy other than <lb/>cedar. 26 <lb/>Table 2 shows utility weights by severity with the <lb/>RS and TTO. Utility weights with RS by the four lev-<lb/>els of severity are 0.82, 0.71, 0.56 and 0.43 from mild <lb/>to severest symptoms, respectively, while with TTO, <lb/>0.96, 0.94, 0.89 and 0.83, respectively. Lower weights <lb/>found by RS may be due to the known tendency in <lb/>the response to RS that respondents are more in-<lb/>clined to mark the point apart from extreme ends of <lb/>the scale. 15 Figure 3 illustrates these by box plots. <lb/></body>

Female respondents <lb/>noted higher weights than males; respondents in age <lb/>strata 40-59 noted the lowest weights; symptomatic <lb/>respondents noted higher weights; and respondents <lb/>with history of pollinosis noted higher weights. In re-<lb/>gards to these differences, effects of characteristics of <lb/>respondents to utility weights were tested with a gen-<lb/>eralised linear model, of which result were statisti-<lb/>cally insignificant in terms of characteristics. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>We elicited utility weights for allergic rhinitis by the <lb/>level of standard clinical stratification of severity de-<lb/>fined by the Practical Guideline for the Management <lb/>of Allergic Rhinitis in Japan. 6 We constructed a self-<lb/>administered questionnaire applying monthly TTO <lb/>for representative samples from the community. Util-<lb/>ity weights by the four levels of severity were found <lb/>to be 0.96, 0.94, 0.89 and 0.83, from mild to severest <lb/>symptoms, respectively. The average weight of these, <lb/>0.91, can be judged as consistent with the formerly <lb/>reported 0.89 for seasonal allergic rhinitis and 0.97 <lb/>for perennial allergic rhinitis in Japan, taking into ac-<lb/>count that EQ-5D was applied to patients in this study <lb/>and that seasonal rhinitis patients experience severer <lb/>symptoms than perennial rhinitis patients. 9 Addition-<lb/>ally, the weights found were stable regardless of re-<lb/>spondents&apos; characteristics such as sex, age, current <lb/>nasal symptoms, or history of cedar pollinosis, which <lb/>allows us to consider the findings of this study as be-<lb/>ing fairly reliable for social preference. <lb/>In particular, we choose to elicit the preference of <lb/>the general public as a social preference assuming <lb/>that individuals without any history of allergic rhinitis <lb/>can imagine the various symptoms of rhinitis. If this <lb/>is not the case, there may be a difference in results <lb/>between subgroups of those with a history of allergic <lb/>rhinitis and those without it. Such a difference may <lb/>raise the problem of how to interpret these as social <lb/>preference. However, no significant differences were <lb/>found in this study. <lb/>There is a point to be noted in interpreting our re-<lb/>sults. Non-response by almost half of the samples <lb/>raises a concern about the ease of answering to our <lb/>devised self-administered TTO questionnaire. How-<lb/>ever, the response rate of 51.0% is more than the <lb/>usual response rates of mail surveys, and comparable <lb/>to those of several recent governmental interview sur-<lb/>veys, 40-50%, of which decline is considered to be <lb/>due to the citizen&apos;s amounting awareness on privacy <lb/>backed up by the enforcement of Personal Informa-<lb/>tion Protection Act in April of 2005. 27 The response <lb/>rate of 51.0% may be judged as low, but it has become <lb/>unrealistic to obtain more representative data in Ja-<lb/>pan. 27 Therefore, the level of response rate of our sur-<lb/>vey can be interpreted as independent from the ease <lb/>of answering, and the questionnaire itself can be con-<lb/>sidered feasible for self-administration. <lb/>Although the clinical stratification of severity em-<lb/>ployed in this study is based on Japanese guidelines, <lb/>the description of symptoms and severities are uni-<lb/>versal enough to be used in other countries. And <lb/>found weights were not so different from 0.87, which <lb/>is reported for hay fever! allergic rhinitis from the <lb/>U.S., although the severity of symptoms is not stated <lb/>in this study. 28 Our results may be applicable to eco-<lb/>nomic evaluations regarding allergic rhinitis in vari-<lb/></body>

			<body>ous contexts in many countries, such as transitioning <lb/>of the second-generation antihistamines to over-the-<lb/>counter status 29,30 or a tablet-based vaccination <lb/>against hay fever. 31-33 <lb/>We devised a monthly TTO by taking advantage of <lb/>seasonality that is quite well-known to the general <lb/>public. The monthly TTO is a new variation that is in-<lb/>between annual TTO and daily TTO, of which con-<lb/>struct validity is ensured. However, empirical com-<lb/>parison with annual TTO and daily TTO may be nec-<lb/>essary, which was not exercised in this study. This <lb/>leaves room for further study. Arnesen and Trom-<lb/>mald (2005) point out that variation in TTO questions <lb/>could undermine the comparability of QALYs across <lb/>diverse health statuses, and suggests that a detailed <lb/>description of the implemented TTO is one way to re-<lb/>lieve this problem. 34 This paper transparently pre-<lb/>sents information required for comparison and dupli-<lb/>cation of technique. <lb/></body>
