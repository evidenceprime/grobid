	<div type="abstract">and the Philippines. The Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey was undertaken to further clarify the prevalence of<lb/> physician-diagnosed nasal allergies (NAs), impact on quality-of-life (QOL), existing treatment paradigms and gaps, and NA medications currently used in<lb/> treatment.<lb/> Methods: Thirty-three thousand three hundred seventy-eight households were screened for individuals, Ն4 years old, with a physician diagnosis of AR or<lb/> NA and either symptoms or treatment in the past 12 months. Standardized questionnaires were used to make comparisons across regions. A total of 1043 adults<lb/> and 192 children were included in the survey.<lb/> Results: Nine percent of participants were diagnosed with AR with two of three responding that their NAs were seasonal in nature. Nasal congestion was<lb/> the most common and bothersome symptom of AR. Most participants reported that AR impacted their QOL with nearly one-half citing impairments in<lb/> school/work performance/productivity. Sleep disturbances, secondary to AR, were also shown to be appreciable. Two-thirds of patients took medication for their<lb/> AR. Less than one-quarter of survey respondents reported taking an intranasal corticosteroid and the satisfaction rate was similar to that of over-the-counter<lb/> medications. The most common reasons cited for dissatisfaction were related to inadequate efficacy and bothersome side effects.<lb/> Conclusion: AR appears to be extremely common across Asia-Pacific nations. Many individuals with AR suffer from symptoms that reduce QOL and<lb/> treatment gaps exist with current therapies. Through identification of disease impact and highlighting treatment gaps, clinicians may better understand and<lb/> treat AR, leading to improvements in overall patient satisfaction and QOL.<lb/></div>

	<div type="abstract">A llergic rhinitis (AR) is a highly prevalent chronic respiratory<lb/> illness that has been linked to multiple comorbid conditions,<lb/> including asthma. 1,2 Poorly controlled AR has been shown to cause<lb/> significant patient discomfort and impairments in work productivity,<lb/> school performance, social interactions, and sleep similar to other<lb/> chronic conditions. 3-9<lb/> Allergic disorders are estimated to affect some 1.4 billion people<lb/> globally and the prevalence continues to increase and now has be-<lb/>come the most common chronic medical condition worldwide requir-<lb/>ing active intervention. 10,11 Recent data from Asia-Pacific suggests<lb/> that there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of AR within<lb/> this region within the past 10 years that exerts a significant economic<lb/> burden. 12-17 Although it is unknown why the prevalence of AR is<lb/> increasing, experts have suggested that it is likely a consequence of<lb/> the changing environment, better hygiene and decreased infections,<lb/> and genetic susceptibilities. 18<lb/> Consistent with treatment guidelines, treatment is usually based on<lb/> patient&apos;s age and severity of symptoms. 19 Intranasal corticosteroids<lb/> (INCSs) are well regarded as the most effective treatment options for<lb/> AR and should be first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate disease. 19,20<lb/> Immunotherapy is another option as a disease modifying therapy for<lb/> AR. Moderate-to-severe disease not responsive to INCSs should be<lb/> treated with the addition of second-line therapies, including antihis-<lb/>tamines, decongestants, cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antagonists,<lb/> and nonpharmacologic therapies. 19<lb/> Effective AR treatment has been shown to improve quality of life<lb/> (QOL) and may even lower the risk of new asthma cases developing<lb/> in adults. 21 Despite these therapeutic benefits, AR often goes unrec-<lb/>ognized by physicians, resulting in inadequate control of symptoms.<lb/> This fact is underscored by a recent survey of Spanish individuals<lb/> with clinically confirmed symptoms of AR that showed that one-third<lb/> of survey participants were not aware that they had the condition,<lb/> and almost one-half had not been diagnosed by their physician. 22<lb/> Several large-scale studies and surveys (e.g., Allergies in America,<lb/></div>
