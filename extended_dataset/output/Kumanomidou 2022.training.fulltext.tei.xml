			<p>Allergic rhinitis (AR), especially seasonal AR caused by pollen, is<lb/> the most prevalent allergic disease, and its prevalence is on the rise.<lb/> For example, the prevalence of Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP), the<lb/> most prevalent AR in Japan, increased from 16.2% in 1998, and<lb/> 26.5% in 2008 to 38.8% in 2019 among Japanese otorhinolaryngol-<lb/>ogists and their families. <ref type="biblio">1,2</ref> Although AR is not a lethal disease, it<lb/> causes substantial burdens on not only the quality of life (QOL) of<lb/> patients, but also the loss of work productivity and health<lb/> resources. <ref type="biblio">1,3e5<lb/></ref> Analyses for the economic evaluation of health resources<lb/> include cost-minimization analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis<lb/> (CEA), cost-utility analysis (CUA), and cost-benefit analysis. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> CEA<lb/> evaluates two alternative treatments in relation to their associated<lb/> costs and health outcomes. <ref type="biblio">7</ref> In CEA, the additional cost per extra<lb/> unit of effect between the intervention and control therapy is<lb/> determined by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER),<lb/> where a low ICER indicates better cost-effectiveness of the new/<lb/> alternative intervention. <ref type="biblio">7</ref> CUA is a specific form of CEA in which the<lb/> health utility of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) is used as a unit of<lb/> effect. <ref type="biblio">7</ref> QALY is a quantifiable measure of patient health that uses a<lb/> scale from 0 (dead) to 1 (perfect health). <ref type="biblio">8</ref> The CUA-based ICER is<lb/> used to allocate healthcare resources, often using a threshold<lb/> approach. In the setting of the National Institute for Health and Care<lb/> Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, the threshold below<lb/> which interventions are generally considered to be cost-effective<lb/> remains at 20,000 Great Britain pounds (GBP) per QALY. <ref type="biblio">9</ref> In<lb/> Japan, the willingness-to-pay value for one QALY was estimated to<lb/> be 5 million Japanese yen (JPY). <ref type="biblio">10<lb/></ref> The most widely accepted method for determining utility from<lb/> 0 (dead) to 1 (perfect health) is the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) instru-<lb/>ment. <ref type="biblio">11</ref> The EQ-5D is the most widely used preference-based<lb/> measure, and it includes five dimensions: mobility, self-care,<lb/> usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, which<lb/> have three response levels of severity from 1 (no problems) to 3<lb/> (extreme problems). <ref type="biblio">12</ref> A value set to estimate utility from EQ-5D<lb/> data was developed in Japan. <ref type="biblio">13</ref> For example, if a subject reports<lb/> level 1 of mobility (I have no problems in walking about), level 2 of<lb/> self-care (I have some problems washing or dressing myself), level 3<lb/> of usual activities (I am unable to perform my usual activities), level<lb/> 1 of pain/discomfort (I have no pain or discomfort), and level 1 of<lb/> anxiety/depression (I am not anxious or depressed), the health<lb/> utility is estimated as 0.661.<lb/></p>

			<p>Using the EQ-5D, one report showed that the utility values were<lb/> 0.89 and 0.97 for seasonal and perennial AR, respectively, in Japa-<lb/>nese subjects. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> However, estimation of utility by the EQ-5D is<lb/> limited in AR, because EQ-5D is a generic and not disease-specific<lb/> questionnaire, and since the original EQ-5D used only three levels<lb/> of severitydfor example, no, moderate, and extreme for pain/dis-<lb/>comfort <ref type="biblio">12<lb/></ref> da ceiling effect was seen as the EQ-5D indicated that<lb/> many AR patients showed perfect health (utility ¼ 1). <ref type="biblio">14e16</ref> To<lb/> reduce the ceiling effect and improve the sensitivity, the EQ-5D-5L<lb/> was developed (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Although the dimensions of EQ-5D-5L are<lb/> identical to EQ-5D, the choice for answer is changed from the three-<lb/>level system to a five-level system: none, slight, moderate, severe,<lb/> and unable/extreme. <ref type="biblio">12</ref> Although a permission is required to use EQ-<lb/>5D-5L, determining utility converted from EQ-5D-5L data by using<lb/> a value set is effectively and simply as compared with SF36, the<lb/> well-known QOL questionnaire. <ref type="biblio">13,17<lb/></ref> The total naso-ocular symptom score (TSS) that examines five<lb/> symptomsdsneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, itchy eyes, and<lb/> watery eyesdis generally used as a primary endpoint in clinical<lb/> trials of AR. <ref type="biblio">18,19</ref> On the other hand, the EQ-5D is not often used in<lb/> clinical trials, making it difficult to determine the QALY using data<lb/> from the trials. When preference-based measures, such as the EQ-<lb/>5D, are not used in a clinical trial, it is possible to &quot;map&quot; measures<lb/> from disease-specific scores to preference-based utilities. <ref type="biblio">16<lb/></ref> Although there have been several reports of mapping from<lb/> disease-specific QOL scores to utility, little is known about mapping<lb/> symptom scores to utility. <ref type="biblio">16,20<lb/></ref> In the present study, we investigated the mapping of the TSS<lb/> to utility by simultaneously using a symptom score questionnaire<lb/> and the EQ-5D-5L based on the Mapping onto Preference-based<lb/> Measures Reporting Standards statement. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> Using utility deter-<lb/>mined by a regression model, we analyzed the ICER of sublingual<lb/> immunotherapy (SLIT) using a Japanese cedar extract drop to<lb/> SLIT using a placebo to determine whether SLIT is cost-effective<lb/> using the data from a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical<lb/> trial. <ref type="biblio">22<lb/></ref></p>

 Methods<lb/> Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>Patients with JCP without severe comorbid non-allergic diseases<lb/> were enrolled from seven hospitals (International University of<lb/> Health and Welfare Hospital, Okayama University Hospital, Kagawa<lb/> Prefectural Central Hospital, Kagawa Rosai Hospital, Ibara City<lb/> Hospital, Himeji Red Cross Hospital, and Himeji St. Mary&apos;s Hospital)<lb/> in 2019 (n ¼ 80) and 2020 (n ¼ 166). Among all of the records, 8<lb/> records in 2020 (4.8%) were omitted, as they did not have complete<lb/> and valid responses for the EQ-5D-5L, leaving a sample of 158 for<lb/> the 2020 analysis. All patients had paroxysmal nasal symptoms,<lb/> such as sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion in the spring,<lb/> and showed sensitization to Japanese cedar pollen by the skin prick<lb/> test and/or the presence of serum specific immunoglobulin E as<lb/> determined by ImmunoCAP (Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Five<lb/> patients in 2019 and 21 patients in 2020 had concomitant asthma. A<lb/> medical history of pollinosis was recorded in 234 patients; among<lb/> them, 81 patients (35 in 2019 and 46 in 2020) did not receive any<lb/> treatment for rhinitis at the time of answering the questionnaire,<lb/> and the rest of the 153 patients received treatment for JCP (phar-<lb/>macotherapy: n ¼ 133; allergen immunotherapy: n ¼ 13; surgery:<lb/> n ¼ 7). None of the patients had used systemic immunosuppressive<lb/></p>

The<lb/> detailed characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 2. Writ-<lb/>ten informed consent was obtained from each subject, and the<lb/> study was approved by the institutional review board of each<lb/> hospital (13-B-322, 1903-042, 806, H30-19, H31-06, 36 and 019-<lb/>65 at the International University of Health and Welfare Hospital,<lb/> Okayama University Hospital, Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital,<lb/> Kagawa Rosai Hospital, Ibara City Hospital, Himeji Red Cross Hos-<lb/>pital, and Himeji St. Mary&apos;s Hospital, and respectively).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Monitoring of symptoms, utility, and pollen dispersion<lb/></head>

			<p>During the pollen season from January to April in 2019 and<lb/> 2020, patients filled out a questionnaire for symptom scores and<lb/> EQ-5D-5L simultaneously. The symptom scores were determined<lb/> using a five-grade scale for the symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea,<lb/> nasal congestion, eye itching, and watery eyes, which are usually<lb/> used in clinical trials in Japan (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). <ref type="biblio">1,19</ref> The TSS is the sum of the<lb/> scores of five individual symptoms that ranges from 0 to 20. The<lb/> total nasal symptom score (TNS) is the sum of the scores of<lb/> sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. The total ocular<lb/> symptom score (TOS) is the sum of the scores of eye itching and<lb/> watery eyes. The severity of AR was rated as none, mild, moderate,<lb/> severe, and most severe based on the criteria in the practical<lb/> guideline for the management of AR in Japan (PG-MARJ). <ref type="biblio">1</ref> Utility<lb/> was calculated by a Japanese version of the EQ-5D-5L value set. <ref type="biblio">23<lb/></ref></p>

 Mapping algorithm<lb/></head>

			<p>We estimated a direct utility mapping model by regressing re-<lb/>sponses to individual TSS questions directly onto utility. The linear<lb/> regression analysis was estimated by GraphPad Prism 8 software<lb/> (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). Any utilities predicted to be &gt;1 were<lb/> set to one.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cost-utility analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>CUA was performed using a dataset from a double-blind pla-<lb/>cebo-controlled clinical trial that was obtained from Torii Phar-<lb/>maceutical Co. Ltd. <ref type="biblio">22</ref> In brief, 267 and 264 subjects with JCP were<lb/> randomly allocated to receive SLIT with a Japanese cedar extract<lb/> drop (active SLIT) or a placebo (placebo SLIT), respectively, starting<lb/> in October 2010. The SLIT group used one bottle with 200 Japanese<lb/> allergy unit (JAU)/ml (421.1 JPY) for the first week, one bottle of<lb/> 2000 JAU/ml (1006.8 JPY) for the second week, then a package of<lb/> 2000 JAU/ml (100.8 JPY/package) daily after the third week. Daily<lb/> nasal symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion) and<lb/> ocular symptoms (eye itchiness and watery eyes) were recorded by<lb/> electric daily from January 8 to April 30 in 2011 and 2012. Patients<lb/> were allowed to use the following relief medications for unbearable<lb/> symptoms: fexofenadine hydrochloride (60-mg tablets, 71.9 JPY/<lb/> tablet in 2011), tramazoline hydrochloride (0.118% nasal solution in<lb/> 10-ml bottles, 72 JPY/bottle), or ketotifen fumarate (0.05%<lb/> ophthalmic solution in 5-ml bottles, 720.2 JPY/bottle). Data ob-<lb/>tained during the pollen season were used for CUA. ICER was<lb/> calculated by the following formula:<lb/></p>

				<formula>ICER ¼ [(Cost active À Cost placebo )/(QALY active À QALY placebo )]<lb/></formula>

			<head>Statistical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>The t-test was used to compare data between two groups, and<lb/> one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey&apos;s test was<lb/> used for multiple comparisons. Correlation analyses were per-<lb/>formed using Pearson correlation coefficient. P values of less than<lb/> 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Statistical ana-<lb/>lyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad).<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/> Utility in JCP patients<lb/></head>

			<p>In total, 80 and 158 patients provided complete EQ-5D-5L data<lb/> in 2019 and 2020, respectively. In 2019, 1, 18, 20, 30, and 11 patients<lb/> were rated as having none, mild, moderate, severe, and the most<lb/> severe JCP. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> One-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference in<lb/> utility determined by the EQ-5D-5L among these groups<lb/> (P &lt; 0.001). Tukey&apos;s test further showed that utility was signifi-<lb/>cantly lower in the most severe group as compared to the mild<lb/> (P &lt; 0.001), moderate (P ¼ 0.005), and severe (P ¼ 0.011) groups<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Similar results were seen in 2020, in which 4, 61, 51, 27,<lb/> and 15 patients were rated as having none, mild, moderate, severe,<lb/> and the most severe JCP. A significant difference in utility was<lb/> observed among these groups (P &lt; 0.001). Tukey&apos;s test showed that<lb/> utility was significantly lower in the most severe group as<lb/> compared to the none (P ¼ 0.005), mild (P &lt; 0.001), and moderate<lb/> (P &lt; 0.001) groups. In addition, utility was also significantly lower<lb/> in the severe group than in the none (P ¼ 0.013), mild (P &lt; 0.001),<lb/> and moderate (P ¼ 0.001) groups. On the other hand, utility did not<lb/> differ between the severe and most severe groups in 2020<lb/> (P ¼ 0.933; Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). When we combined the data from the two<lb/> years (n ¼ 238), a more significant association was seen between<lb/></p>

			<p>disease severity and utility; the utility values were 1.000 ± 0.000,<lb/> 0.943 ± 0.085, 0.909 ± 0.095, 0.849 ± 0.142, and 0.767 ± 0.175 in the<lb/> none, mild, moderate, severe, and most severe groups, respectively<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). Among the patients in the none, mild, moderate, severe,<lb/> and most severe groups, 5 (100%), 50 (63.3%), 31 (43.7%), 17 (29.8%),<lb/> and 4 (15.4%) patients, respectively, showed perfect health<lb/> (utility ¼ 1). No significant difference in the utility was seen be-<lb/>tween patients with and without treatment for JCP (P ¼ 0.411;<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref>). In the no-treatment group, no sex difference was seen in<lb/> utility (P ¼ 0.683; Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>). Seven patients in the no-treatment group<lb/> had concomitant asthma; they showed significantly lower utility as<lb/> compared to the confirmed non-asthmatic patients (n ¼ 69,<lb/> P ¼ 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Correlation between symptom scores and utility<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2019, a negative and significant correlation was seen between<lb/> the TSS, which comprised five naso-ocular symptoms, and utility<lb/> (r ¼ À0.536 (95% confidence interval (CI): À0.676 to À0.359),<lb/> P &lt; 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). Similar results were seen in 2020 (r ¼ À0.498<lb/> (95% CI: À0.607 to À0.370), P &lt; 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). The significant<lb/> negative correlation was still seen when we combined the data<lb/> from the two years (r ¼ À0.495 (95% CI: À0.585 to À0.392),<lb/> P &lt; 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). Both the TNS, which comprised three nasal<lb/> symptoms, and the TOS, which comprised two ocular symptoms,<lb/> also showed a significant negative correlation with utility; how-<lb/>ever, the TNS showed a stronger correlation (r ¼ À0.499 (95%<lb/> CI: À0.589 to À0.398) vs. r ¼ À0.351 (95% CI: À0.458 to À0.234))<lb/> than the TOS in the combined data. All individual symptoms also<lb/> showed a significant negative correlation with utility (P &lt; 0.001,<lb/> except for watery eyes in 2019, which had a P value of 0.003;<lb/> Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Mapping algorithm<lb/></head>

			<p>Linear regression modeling was applied to develop an algorithm<lb/> for mapping the TSS to utility. Because the presence of asthma is a<lb/> confounding factor of utility, we first developed a model in patients<lb/> without comorbid asthma. In 2019, best-fit values for the slope and<lb/> Y(utility)-intercept were À0.0167 (95% CI: À0.023 to À0.010) and<lb/> 1.031 (95% CI: 0.974 to 1.088), respectively. Thus, the estimated<lb/> equation for 2019 was: Y(utility) ¼ À0.0167*X(TSS) þ 1.031. A<lb/> similar estimation was seen in 2020, for which the best-fit values for<lb/> the slope and Y(utility)-intercept were À0.0175 (95% CI: À0.023<lb/> to À0.012) and 1.002 (95% CI: 0.965 to 1.039), respectively. When we<lb/> combined the data of the two years (n¼ 203), the estimated equa-<lb/>tion was: Y(utility) ¼ À0.0161*X(TSS) þ1.005. In asthmatic patients<lb/> (n¼26), the estimated equation was: Y(utility)¼À0.0181*X(TSS)þ<lb/> 1.002 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>CUA of SLIT for JCP<lb/></head>

			<p>We estimated the mean QALY in patients who received either<lb/> active SLIT or placebo SLIT. Because none of the subjects had<lb/> experienced an asthma attack within the previous 5 years, we<lb/> chose to use the calculation formula for non-asthmatic patients.<lb/> The estimated mean utility values in active and placebo SLIT pa-<lb/>tients in 2011 were 0.882 ± 0.056 and 0.864 ± 0.056, respectively,<lb/> and they showed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.001).

			<p>The estimated mean utility values in active and placebo SLIT pa-<lb/>tients in 2012 were 0.931 ± 0.053 and 0.908 ± 0.058, respectively,<lb/> and they showed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.001). The estimated<lb/> mean QALY in the active and placebo SLIT patients in 2012 can be<lb/> estimated to be 0.233 ± 0.013 and 0.227 ± 0.014, respectively.<lb/> When we assumed that SLIT was started on the first day of<lb/> October 2010, patients receiving active SLIT used one 200-JAU/ml<lb/> bottle, one 2000-JAU/ml bottle, and 198 2000-JAU/ml packs. The<lb/> estimated cost for SLIT for the 2011 pollen season was 21,386.3 JPY.<lb/> Drug costs of rescue medications were estimated to be 1686 and<lb/> 2824 JPY for the active and placebo SLIT groups, respectively<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). The ICER of active SLIT to placebo SLIT in the 2011<lb/> pollen season was estimated to be 4,049,720 JPY/QALY<lb/> ([<ref type="biblio">(21,386.3þ1686</ref>.3)À(0þ2824.0)]/(0.221 À 0.216)). After the end of<lb/> the 2011 pollen season, patients receiving active SLIT used 363 of the<lb/> 2000-JAU/ml packs until the end of the 2012 pollen season. The<lb/> estimated cost for SLIT for the 2012 pollen season was 36,590.4 JPY.<lb/> Drug costs for rescue medications during the 2012 pollen season<lb/> were estimated to be 594.9 and 1073.0 JPY for the active and placebo<lb/> SLIT groups, respectively. The ICER of active SLIT to placebo SLIT in<lb/> the 2012 pollen season was estimated to be 6,011,217 JPY/QALY<lb/> ([(36,590 þ 549.9) À (0 þ 1073.0)]/(0.233e0.227)).<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>In the present study, we mapped symptom scores of JCP to<lb/> utility using the EQ-5D-5L. We found that utility decreased with<lb/> increasing severity of JCP, and linear regression modeling showed<lb/> that the estimated equation is: Y(utility) ¼ À0.0161*X(TSS) þ 1.005<lb/> in non-asthmatic JCP patients. When we used this algorithm, CUA<lb/> showed that SLIT with Japanese cedar pollen extract was cost-<lb/>effective, because the ICER of active SLIT to placebo SLIT in 2011<lb/> (4.05 million JPY per QALY), but not 2012 (6.01 million JPY per<lb/> QALY), was below 5 million JPY per QALY, the threshold for price<lb/> adjustment downward in the Health Technology Assessment pro-<lb/>cess in Japan. <ref type="biblio">25</ref> This threshold can be used regardless of seriousness<lb/> of illness. Rather, the threshold of 7.5 million JPY per QALY is used<lb/> for pediatric or intractable and rare diseases in Japan. <ref type="biblio">26<lb/></ref> The EQ-5D-5L was developed to reduce the ceiling effect. <ref type="biblio">12</ref> The<lb/> present study showed that 44.4% of untreated JCP patients showed<lb/> perfect health (utility ¼ 1) according to the EQ-5D-5L. This rate is<lb/> lower than that of a previous report performed in <ref type="biblio">2003</ref> showing<lb/> that perfect health was seen in 58% of untreated patient with<lb/> seasonal AR in March. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> Together with the finding that the annual<lb/> amount of dispersed Japanese cedar pollen has been increasing<lb/> gradually over time, this result suggests that the ceiling effect was<lb/> lessened by using the EQ-5D-5L for JCP. <ref type="biblio">27<lb/></ref> The present study showed that the utility weight decreased<lb/> with increasing severity of JCP; the utility values were 0.943, 0.909,<lb/> 0.849, and 0.767 in the mild, moderate, severe, and most severe JCP<lb/> groups, respectively. Tamayama et al. reported an association be-<lb/>tween the utility weights and the severity of JCP using rating scale<lb/> (RS) and time trade-off (TTO) measurements. <ref type="biblio">28</ref> They found that the<lb/> utility weights in mild, moderate, severe, and severest (most se-<lb/>vere) JCP were 0.82, 0.71, 0.56, and 0.43, respectively, with RS<lb/> measurements, and 0.96, 0.94, 0.89, and 0.83, respectively, with<lb/> TTO measurements. Our results were consistent with the results<lb/> from TTO measurements. In fact, Tamayama et al. suggested that<lb/> the lower weights seen with the RS measurements may be due to<lb/> the known tendency for responders to be more inclined to mark<lb/> responses at extreme ends of the scale. <ref type="biblio">28<lb/></ref> A few reports have demonstrated the mapping of the symptom<lb/> scores of AR to utility. Dick et al. developed a two-part mapping<lb/> algorithm by calculating disutility from data with daily symptom<lb/> scores, daily medication scores, asthma symptom scores, and<lb/></p>

			<p>rhinoconjunctivitis QOL questionnaire (RQLQ) scores. <ref type="biblio">20</ref> Because a<lb/> negative and significant correlation was seen between symptom<lb/> scores and utility, we mapped the TSS to utility by linear regression<lb/> analysis. This simple mapping algorithm enabled us to perform CUA<lb/> of clinical trials for AR, because the major endpoint in the trials was<lb/> the symptom scores.<lb/></p>

			<p>CUA of SLIT for AR has been investigated in several previous<lb/> reports, especially grass pollen-induced AR. In earlier reports using<lb/> a grass allergen tablet (Grazax®) in southern Europe, the mean<lb/> utility determined by the EQ-5D(-3L) was 0.9626 in the Grazax®<lb/> group and 0.9459 in the standard care group. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> Based on the annual<lb/> cost of SLIT with Grazax® ranging from V900 to V2900, the ICER<lb/> was V13,870 per QALY in France, V20,690 per QALY in Italy,<lb/> V20.955 per QALY in Austria, and V21,659 per QALY in Spain; all of<lb/> these were below the cost-effectiveness threshold of the NICE of<lb/> 20,000 GBP. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> Similar results using the same tablet were seen in<lb/> Northern Europe. <ref type="biblio">30</ref> Similarly, the ICER of SLIT with Grazax® in<lb/> combination with symptomatic medication to symptomatic medi-<lb/>cation alone was V12,168 per QALY in pediatric patients with grass<lb/> pollen allergy. <ref type="biblio">9</ref> SLIT with a house dust mite tablet for the treatment<lb/> of house dust mite AR also showed cost-effectiveness as the ICER of<lb/> SLIT plus allergy pharmacotherapy to placebo plus pharmaco-<lb/>therapy was V7519. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> When we converted the TSS to utility using<lb/> the proposed mapping algorithm in the present study and esti-<lb/>mated the QALY based on the fact that JCP usually lasts for<lb/> 3 months/year, the ICERs of active SLIT plus symptomatic medica-<lb/>tion to placebo plus symptomatic medication in the 2011 and 2012<lb/> pollen seasons were estimated to be 4,049,720 JPY and 6,011,217<lb/> JPY per QALY, respectively. These results suggest that pre-seasonal<lb/> SLIT with the Japanese cedar extract drop is cost-effective for JCP,<lb/> because the ICERs were below the cost-effectiveness threshold of<lb/> the willing-to-pay value of 5 million JPY per QALY in Japan. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> These<lb/> results also suggest that pre-seasonal SLIT for JCP has similar cost-<lb/>effectiveness to grass pollen tablet and house dust mite<lb/> tablet. <ref type="biblio">15,29,30</ref> Although the ICER of the whole-year SLIT to placebo<lb/> exceeded the threshold of 5 million JPY per QALY, this treatment<lb/> may achieve cost-effectiveness after discontinuation, because it is<lb/> known that its efficacy can persist for at least 3 years after the<lb/> discontinuation of allergen immunotherapy including JCP. <ref type="biblio">31,32<lb/></ref> There are limitations to this study. First, the sample size was<lb/> relatively small when compared to previous reports investigating<lb/> mapping. <ref type="biblio">16,20</ref> This may have led to a weaker correlation (r ¼ À0.495)<lb/> between the TSS and QALY. Second, although the grading system of<lb/> the TSS presented here is the same as that broadly used in clinical<lb/> trials for AR in Japan, it is not common in other countries. <ref type="biblio">18,19</ref> In the<lb/> present study, we graded the naso-ocular symptoms of sneezing,<lb/> rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, eye itching, and watery eyes using a<lb/> five-grade scale based on the number of episodes of paroxysmal<lb/> sneezing in a day, number of episodes of nose blowing in a day,<lb/> duration of mouth breathing in a day, frequency of rubbing eyes in a<lb/> day, and frequency of wiping tears in a day. <ref type="biblio">1,19</ref> However, in other<lb/> countries, the severity of symptoms is usually graded with a four-<lb/>grade scale: no symptoms, mild symptoms (easily tolerated), mod-<lb/>erate symptoms (bothersome, but tolerated), and sever symptoms<lb/> (hard to tolerate and interferes with daily activities). <ref type="biblio">33</ref> Third, it ap-<lb/>pears that the ceiling effect was observed even with the use of EQ-<lb/>5D-5L. Although the ratio of patients showing perfect health (1<lb/> QALY) decreased with increasing severity of AR, 29.8% of the severe<lb/> JCP group and 15.4% of the most severe JCP group showed perfect<lb/> health. It is known that generic QOL questionnaires, especially those<lb/> with small items, such as the SF-8, show low sensitivity as compared<lb/> to disease-specific QOL questionnaires in AR. <ref type="biblio">34</ref> Because AR is not a<lb/> life-threatening disease, many patients with JCP may not pay so<lb/> much attention to the items of EQ-5D-5L, including mobility,<lb/> self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.<lb/></p>

			<p>Fourth, the SLIT data are relatively old. Currently, a Japanese cedar<lb/> extract tablet with a higher content (5000 JAU) is used in SLIT for<lb/> JCP. <ref type="biblio">35</ref> In the future, CUA should be performed with this new formula.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, we proposed a mapping algorithm that converts<lb/> the TSS to QALY. Although a strong correlation was not seen be-<lb/>tween the TSS and QALY, this proposed algorithm may provide a<lb/> basis for the economical evaluation of medical treatments,<lb/> including clinical trials for AR.</p>
