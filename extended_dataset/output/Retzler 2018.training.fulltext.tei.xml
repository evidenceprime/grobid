			<head>Introduction<lb/> Background<lb/></head>

			<p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic inflammatory condition<lb/> affecting the upper airways, caused by an excess of immu-<lb/>noglobin E produced in response to environmental allergens<lb/> such as house dust mites and pollen. AR affects 17-26% of<lb/> the population in Europe, with prevalence expected to rise<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. While the symptoms of nasal blockage, sneezing and<lb/> itching <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref> may be thought of as trivial, research shows they<lb/> have a detrimental impact on health-related quality of life<lb/> (HRQoL), disturbing sleep, concentration and productivity<lb/> at work or school, and the ability to conduct daily activities<lb/> and causing widespread discomfort <ref type="biblio">[3, 4]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The persistence and nature of symptoms experienced can<lb/> vary depending on the allergen(s) responsible and the pat-<lb/>tern of exposure. When AR is triggered by pollen, ocular<lb/> inflammation can occur alongside nasal symptoms, broad-<lb/>ening the condition to allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC),<lb/> commonly known as &apos;hay fever&apos;. Individuals may respond to<lb/> multiple allergens, and AR/ARC is further complicated by<lb/> commonly presenting with asthma, a chronic inflammatory<lb/> condition of the lower airways that causes coughing, wheez-<lb/>ing, chest tightness and breathlessness <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">1 3<lb/></ref> AR/ARC is found in over 80% of asthma patients, and<lb/> asthma is found in 20-60% of those with AR/ARC <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>,<lb/> leading researchers to hypothesise that AR/ARC and<lb/> asthma are manifestations of the same disease, affecting<lb/> different parts of a &apos;united airway&apos; <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>. Moreover, AR/<lb/> ARC often precedes asthma onset, and has been shown to<lb/> be one of the strongest independent risk factors for asthma<lb/> development <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>, with evidence that AR/ARC can increase<lb/> the risk of adult-onset asthma threefold <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref> and that AR<lb/> severity can impact asthma symptom control <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. Once<lb/> developed, asthma commonly requires lifelong treatment<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>, with comorbid disease impacting HRQoL to a greater<lb/> extent than AR or asthma alone, particularly detrimental<lb/> to physical functioning <ref type="biblio">[3, 9]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Recommended first-line treatments for AR/ARC are usu-<lb/>ally allergen avoidance and pharmacological symptom man-<lb/>agement <ref type="biblio">[1, 6]</ref>. It can be difficult to avoid airborne allergens<lb/> like pollen and house dust mites, however, and symptom-<lb/>relieving medications, commonly anti-histamine or corti-<lb/>costeroid based, do not target the cause of the disease, and<lb/> are therefore unlikely to prevent asthma onset <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. For some<lb/> patients, these treatment options are ineffective, and even<lb/> where symptoms are managed successfully, patients are<lb/> required to maintain daily treatment indefinitely. Allergy<lb/> immunotherapy (AIT) is a treatment option available to<lb/> patients with AR/ARC whose symptoms are not adequately<lb/> controlled by symptom-relieving medication. AIT aims to<lb/> desensitise the immune response to trigger allergens, thereby<lb/> treating the underlying disease. Evidence indicates that AIT<lb/> in childhood can reduce the risk of developing comorbid<lb/> asthma 7 years after treatment <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Health technology appraisal agencies increasingly stipu-<lb/>late cost-utility analysis (CUA) as a part of the assessment<lb/> of new technologies. CUA compares the incremental costs<lb/> and health benefits of two or more interventions. Health<lb/> benefits are measured as health utilities, allowing for stand-<lb/>ardised comparison across different disease areas. Health<lb/> utilities represent the value a particular population places<lb/> on the impact of a health condition on HRQoL, thereby<lb/> combining HRQoL with the &apos;desirability&apos; of a condition.<lb/> Correspondingly, disutility can also be measured. Disutil-<lb/>ity represents the decrement in utility due to a particular<lb/> symptom or complication, and is calculated by measuring<lb/> the difference between two health states that are identical<lb/> in all aspects aside from the complication or symptoms of<lb/> interest <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Utility inputs for the different combinations of seasonal<lb/> ARC and associated health states that may be required for<lb/> CUA are scarce, and, to our knowledge, non-existent in pae-<lb/>diatric populations. This study aimed to generate a set of<lb/> utilities and disutilities from four European countries for<lb/> seasonal ARC and associated conditions, in both adult and<lb/> paediatric populations, for use in future cost-utility analyses.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/> Ethical approval<lb/></head>

			<p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declara-<lb/>tion of Helsinki and ethical approval was granted by the<lb/> University of York Health Sciences research ethics com-<lb/>mittee. Informed parental consent was provided for all child<lb/> respondents.<lb/></p>

			<head>Health states<lb/></head>

			<p>Fourteen health states (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) were defined that repre-<lb/>sented three levels of severity in ARC (mild, moderate and<lb/> severe), during and outside pollen season, in combination<lb/> with comorbidities of asthma, and allergic rhinitis triggered<lb/> by perennial allergens. Vignettes describing these states<lb/> were developed using current clinical guidelines (Allergic<lb/> Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>, Global Ini-<lb/>tiative of Asthma (GINA) <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>) to incorporate (i) symptoms,<lb/> (ii) how symptoms impact daily life and (iii) commonly<lb/> required treatments.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two expert clinicians (one paediatric specialist) provided<lb/> written feedback on the vignettes. Revised vignettes were<lb/> sent to eight patients with seasonal ARC and the associ-<lb/>ated health conditions (four patients with seasonal and/or<lb/> perennial ARC/AR and four patients with seasonal and/or<lb/> perennial ARC/AR and asthma), for a second review. Final<lb/> vignettes were developed incorporating all feedback.<lb/></p>

			<head>Elicitation methods<lb/></head>

			<p>The study task differed for the adult and child surveys.<lb/> A standard gamble (SG) task was designed for the adult<lb/> survey. SG tasks are the only technique that truly reflects<lb/> decisions under uncertainty, thereby mimicking the circum-<lb/>stances under which we make health decisions in real life<lb/> and meeting assumptions of expected utility theory. Due to<lb/> comprehension issues within the child sample age range<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref> and the use of a comparator of &apos;death&apos;, the SG was not<lb/> considered appropriate for the child survey. Instead, a visual<lb/> analogue scale (VAS) was designed for the child study.<lb/></p>

			<p>SG tasks present respondents with a health state<lb/> description, asking them to imagine they experience the<lb/> symptoms described. Respondents must then decide at<lb/> what probability they would decide in favour of a risky<lb/> treatment in order to be cured, with a risk of death should<lb/> the treatment fail, or whether, instead, to remain in the<lb/> certain health state (i.e. unwilling to go ahead with risky<lb/> treatment, instead preferring to continue to experience all<lb/> the symptoms described). The probability of treatment<lb/> success vs. failure that respondents would be willing to<lb/> accept corresponds to the health utility. For each health<lb/> state, SG items were developed, asking respondents to<lb/> indicate their minimum &apos;acceptable&apos; probability using a<lb/> slider.<lb/></p>

			<p>Vignettes designed for adults were adapted for lower<lb/> reading ages, describing the symptoms that, for example,<lb/> &apos;Alex&apos; was feeling, to make them concrete. A VAS ques-<lb/>tion and scale followed, asking children to estimate how<lb/> well they thought that &apos;Alex&apos; was feeling on a scale of<lb/> 0-100, where 0 is the worst they think anyone could pos-<lb/>sibly feel, and 100 is the best they think anyone could<lb/> possibly feel. They were presented with a graphical slider<lb/> with images of happy and sad faces at the relevant ends<lb/> for context.<lb/></p>

			<head>Survey<lb/></head>

			<p>Surveys were developed using the Qualtrics online sur-<lb/>vey platform. Part one recorded demographic information<lb/> and the remaining items comprised 8 of the 14 SG/VAS<lb/> items per respondent (to maintain an acceptable respondent<lb/> burden), randomised with even presentation using the in-<lb/>built algorithm on the Qualtrics platform. The surveys took<lb/> approximately 10 min to complete.<lb/></p>

			<p>Following finalisation of the UK version of the surveys,<lb/> survey text was translated by specialist health translators<lb/> (TransPerfect Translations) into French, Slovakian and Ger-<lb/>man. This process comprised forward and backward transla-<lb/>tions, followed by resolution processes to reconcile any dif-<lb/>ferences and ensure conceptual equivalence in all languages.<lb/></p>

			<p>Translations were migrated to the online platform, where<lb/> data were collected into a single database for adults, and a<lb/> single database for children, regardless of the language of<lb/> completion.<lb/></p>

			<p>The sample was recruited by a third party (Qualtrics)<lb/> which maintains online panel respondents who are invited<lb/> to participate in online surveys in exchange for electronic<lb/> points. The adult sample was selected to be broadly rep-<lb/>resentative of the adult general population in each of the<lb/> four countries (UK, France, Germany and Slovakia). Res-<lb/>idents of these countries over the age of 18 years with<lb/> and without ARC and associated conditions were eligi-<lb/>ble. To achieve a representative sample, quotas were set<lb/> based on age and gender (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). When these quotas<lb/> were full, respondents meeting criteria for full quotas were<lb/> no longer eligible. Recruitment was ongoing until 350<lb/> complete responses were received per country, ensuring<lb/> at least 200 responses per health state. The child sample<lb/> comprised children aged 8-11 years, with the upper limit<lb/> reflecting the age at which child-specific drug labelling<lb/> changes (12 years), and the lower limit based on evidence<lb/> on the minimum age (8 years) for task comprehension<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. Due to the narrow age range, the sample was strati-<lb/>fied by gender only. Residents in the UK, France, Germany<lb/> or Slovakia aged 8-11 were eligible. As with the adult<lb/> sample, quotas were used to achieve sample stratification,<lb/> and respondents meeting criteria for full quotas were no<lb/> longer eligible (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Recruitment was ongoing until<lb/> 260 (fewer than adults due to difficulty reaching respond-<lb/>ents in this age group) complete responses were received<lb/> per country, ensuring at least 150 responses per health<lb/> state.<lb/></p>

			<p>Following email invitation, respondents completed<lb/> the survey online. Survey invites for the children were<lb/> sent to parents to ensure informed parental consent. Adult<lb/> respondents and consenting parents of child respondents<lb/> completed the pre-screening demographic questions to<lb/> ensure that only those who met eligibility criteria were<lb/> directed to complete the full survey.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>Data were exported into SPSS (v24.0) for statistical analy-<lb/>sis. Descriptive statistics detailing the socio-demographic<lb/> data for the sample (e.g. gender, age, employment status)<lb/> were generated.<lb/></p>

			<p>Extreme values, or those that lacked face validity, were<lb/> removed where appropriate. All exclusion rules applied<lb/> are described at each analysis. Average values (mean and<lb/> median) for utilities and disutilities were calculated from<lb/> the respondent-level data. Analyses of variance (ANO-<lb/>VAs) were conducted to investigate differences between<lb/> utilities and disutilities generated by patient and non-<lb/>patient populations for the relevant health states (i.e. those<lb/> involving only that patient group). &apos;Patients&apos; were defined<lb/> as any respondent who self-reported either current or pre-<lb/>vious diagnosis of asthma, allergic rhinitis or hay fever.<lb/> Where violations of ANOVA assumptions were identified,<lb/> appropriate alternatives are reported (e.g. Brown-Forsythe<lb/> F statistics).<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/> Study population<lb/></head>

			<p>A total of 1454 adults (UK: 362, France: 368, Germany:<lb/> 359, Slovakia: 365) and 1082 children (UK: 263, France:<lb/> 273, Slovakia: 273, Germany: 273) completed the survey.<lb/> For each country, the age and gender sample stratifications<lb/> broadly met the target criteria to generate samples repre-<lb/>sentative of the general population in each country (see<lb/> Supplementary Material for target and actual demograph-<lb/>ics per country). Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows that there were high levels<lb/> of adults self-reporting previously experiencing ARC, with<lb/> fewer respondents self-reporting other diagnoses. Rates of<lb/> relevant diagnoses were higher still in children, with 55%<lb/> parents reporting that their child had experienced ARC.<lb/></p>

These values were<lb/> also considered to be lacking face validity, and indicative of<lb/> respondents not responding in a thoughtful manner or having<lb/> misunderstood the question. The child data included greater<lb/> numbers of low utility values, and those lower than 0.3 were<lb/> not outliers according to the interquartile range (IQR) rule<lb/> (greater than 1.5 × IQR above the upper or below the lower<lb/> quartile); however, values below this level were still consid-<lb/>ered to be lacking face validity and thus, for both datasets,<lb/> responses for individuals who produced ratings lower than<lb/> 0.3 for any health state were removed. This resulted in inclu-<lb/>sion of 1235 adults (exclusions per country: UK: 54; France:<lb/> 55; Germany: 53; Slovakia: 57) and 423 children (exclu-<lb/>sions per country: UK: 133; France: 151; Germany: 166;<lb/> Slovakia: 209). The impact of different exclusion criteria on<lb/> sample size and utility estimates was examined in sensitivity<lb/> analyses (see Supplementary Material B). Average utilities<lb/> obtained are shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Results were largely consistent with expectations,<lb/> whereby more severe health states were valued lowest, and<lb/> milder health states were valued higher. However, paradoxi-<lb/>cal findings were observed in that for both severe ARC and<lb/> perennial AR, health utilities were rated lower than for the<lb/> same condition with comorbid well-to-partly controlled<lb/> asthma. The small differences here indicate little differen-<lb/>tiation between the comorbid and isolated cases of these<lb/> conditions on an aggregate level, likely a consequence of<lb/> only a sub-sample having rated both conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Utilities rated by children were substantially lower than<lb/> those rated by adults for all health states. As in the adult<lb/> population, results were largely consistent with expectations<lb/> with more severe health states valued lowest, and milder<lb/> health states valued higher. Again, there were some slight<lb/> inconsistencies; utility for uncontrolled asthma alone was<lb/> rated as slightly poorer than for uncontrolled asthma comor-<lb/>bid with perennial AR, mild ARC or moderate ARC. Such<lb/> issues are considered in the calculation of disutilities, which<lb/> were calculated at the respondent level between respondents<lb/> who rated both of the health states.<lb/></p>

			<p>One-way ANOVAs demonstrated that most utility esti-<lb/>mates did not change significantly whether rated by patients<lb/> or non-patients with the exception that adult utilities for<lb/> perennial AR were rated significantly lower by adults self-<lb/>reporting allergic rhinitis experience (0.817) than those not<lb/> (0.849; p = .042).<lb/></p>

			<head>Disutilities<lb/></head>

			<p>Disutilities were calculated at the respondent level, and then<lb/> averaged across the samples, excluding any respondents who<lb/> valued less severe health states as lower than more severe<lb/> health states. Disutilities were generally highest for changes<lb/> between the mildest and most severe health states, and for<lb/> relative differences between isolated health states and those<lb/> with uncontrolled asthma (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>One-way ANOVAs revealed that, for the most part, disu-<lb/>tilities did not differ significantly between patients and non-<lb/>patients (and as such, are not reported separately), with only<lb/> child disutilities comparing moderate and severe ARC that<lb/> were significantly larger in children whose parents reported<lb/> that they have suffered with seasonal ARC (0.135) compared<lb/> with those children with no parent-reported seasonal ARC<lb/> (0.073; p = .020).<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>The utilities and disutilities generated in this study demon-<lb/>strate how living with ARC and associated health conditions<lb/> impacts HRQoL. In particular, the disutilities calculated<lb/> indicate how increases in severity and morbidity reduce<lb/> HRQoL, with the largest disutilities observed between the<lb/> mild and severe forms of ARC and between isolated ARC<lb/> and ARC with comorbid uncontrolled asthma.<lb/></p>

			<p>Mean utilities generated for symptoms of ARC during<lb/> pollen season were between 0.831 (severe) and 0.880 (mild;<lb/> medians 0.888-0.967) in adult populations, and lower still<lb/> in paediatric populations, at between 0.666 (severe) and<lb/> 0.705 (mild; medians 0.600-0.700). These adult values sit<lb/> between those reported in other published literature. EQ-<lb/>5D-3L trial data published in Poole et al. <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> reported peak<lb/> season utility values of 0.888-0.947 in patients with mod-<lb/>erate-to-severe grass pollen allergies, closer to the median<lb/> values elicited in the current study than the mean values.<lb/> Conversely, Petersen et al. <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref> reported EQ-5D-3L utili-<lb/>ties for symptomatic ARC that were much lower than those<lb/> observed in the current study, at 0.70 for individuals with<lb/> ARC and 0.72 for those with ARC and comorbid perennial<lb/> AR. It should be noted that the trial population in Petersen<lb/> et al. <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref> included approximately 50% patients with comor-<lb/>bid asthma, which may have influenced the lower utility<lb/> reported, however, the paper did not report utilities separated<lb/> by presence of comorbidity. Given the absence of previously<lb/> published paediatric estimates, it remains unclear whether<lb/> the difference in magnitude of values elicited by adults and<lb/> children reflects true differences in priorities. The possibility<lb/> that they result from either methodological differences or the<lb/> difficulties of conducting such studies in child populations<lb/> is discussed in the Limitations section.<lb/></p>

			<p>To our knowledge, no published studies have previously<lb/> reported utilities for ARC with comorbid asthma. The mag-<lb/>nitude of adult utility values in the present study for seasonal<lb/> ARC conditions with comorbid asthma was lower than in<lb/> those with no comorbidities, at between 0.812 and 0.872<lb/> (medians 0.851-0.947). Disutilities were calculated at the<lb/> respondent level, between individuals presented with both<lb/> the single and comorbid health states in question. Adults<lb/> estimated a utility decrement of 0.048-0.070 (depending on<lb/> the severity of each morbidity) associated with the presence<lb/> of asthma alongside ARC. Again, the utility estimates gen-<lb/>erated by paediatric populations were considerably lower,<lb/></p>

			<p>while disutilities were higher, a pattern that was observed<lb/> across the board.<lb/> Finally, utility estimates elicited for asthma in isolation<lb/> were broadly in line with the limited data available, such as<lb/> Briggs et al. <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>, which reports mapped utility values of<lb/> 0.857 for well-controlled asthma and 0.798 for &apos;not well-<lb/>controlled asthma&apos;. The current study found mean adult-gen-<lb/>erated asthma utility values to be at 0.829 (median 0.884) for<lb/> uncontrolled asthma, and 0.874 (median 0.949) for well-to-<lb/>partly controlled asthma. Mean child-generated utilities were<lb/> lower, at 0.635 (median 0.620) for uncontrolled asthma, and<lb/> 0.693 (median 0.700) for well-to-partly controlled asthma.<lb/></p>

			<head>Clinical meaningfulness<lb/></head>

			<p>There are no established minimally important differences<lb/> for SG-elicited or VAS-elicited utility in this health area;<lb/> however, using the average minimally important differ-<lb/>ences estimated for the EQ-5D and SF-6D -elicited utilities<lb/> as a guide (SF-6D: 0.04; EQ-5D: 0.07; Walters and Brazier<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>), the disutility associated with increases in severity<lb/> of ARC or comorbidity would be considered to represent<lb/> clinically meaningful drops in HRQoL. The lowest disutil-<lb/>ity observed for the adult sample was 0.048 (the impact of<lb/> comorbid well-to-partly controlled asthma on mild ARC),<lb/> up to 0.091, while those for children varied between 0.089<lb/> (median 0.065) and 0.172 (median 0.130).<lb/></p>

			<p>Moreover, comparison with a US study that generated<lb/> EQ-5D-3L utility values for a wide variety of chronic condi-<lb/>tions <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref> indicates that values of 0.831-0.880 elicited for<lb/> ARC in the current study by adults are in line with their<lb/> values of 0.853 for allergic rhinitis and 0.853 for chronic<lb/> sinusitis, similar conditions to ARC. Relative to less similar<lb/> chronic conditions with utilities in this range, comparison<lb/> of values suggests that ARC impacts HRQoL to a similar<lb/> level as psoriasis (0.834), benign breast disease (0.852) and<lb/> urinary calculi (calcium stones in the urinary tract; 0.838).<lb/> The adult values elicited for ARC conditions with comor-<lb/>bid asthma in the current study were as low as 0.812, cor-<lb/>responding closely with the EQ-5D-3L utilities elicited in<lb/> Sullivan and Ghushchyan <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref> for respiratory system dis-<lb/>eases (0.816) and suggesting a similar impact on HRQoL to<lb/> chronic conditions such as malignant skin growths (0.812),<lb/> menopausal disorders (0.817) and urinary tract disorders<lb/> (0.826).<lb/></p>

			<head>Health economic modelling<lb/></head>

			<p>CUA uses the concept of health utility, rather than HRQoL<lb/> per se, or another measure of clinical effectiveness, in order<lb/> to weight the value of the impact on HRQoL to reflect the<lb/> value attributed to that impact by a particular population,<lb/> commonly the general public. The current study generated<lb/> sets of values from both adult and child populations, and<lb/> thus provides a source of utilities that aim to reflect the pri-<lb/>orities and preferences of the paediatric population in addi-<lb/>tion to adults. Given that parents may not accurately perceive<lb/> even their own child&apos;s HRQoL <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>, the paediatric values<lb/> generated here may be a more accurate reflection of the ways<lb/> in which the symptoms associated with ARC and asthma<lb/> impact a child&apos;s life, and the value that such impacts hold<lb/> for children. However, as always within economic model-<lb/>ling, sensitivity and scenario analyses should be conducted<lb/> to assess the uncertainty within the model and the impact of<lb/> using alternative utility and disutility estimates.<lb/></p>

			<p>This study has generated values for a wide range of health<lb/> states; however, modelling requirements may, in some cases,<lb/> require aggregation of two or more health states, for exam-<lb/>ple, the estimation of an overall utility value for asthma. In<lb/> such cases, averages should be weighted by the proportion<lb/> of the population to which each respective health state would<lb/> apply.<lb/></p>

			<p>The study sample included large numbers of respondents<lb/> self-reporting suffering with ARC, and associated condi-<lb/>tions, highlighting the widespread nature of the diseases.<lb/> Estimates between patients and non-patients were very simi-<lb/>lar. Given the volume of individuals reporting experience<lb/> with these conditions in the general population (and, cor-<lb/>respondingly, the large proportion of the general population<lb/> that would be excluded in samples excluding patient groups)<lb/> and that patient status made few differences, utilities elicited<lb/> from a general population sample including both patients<lb/> and non-patients (as recruited in the current study) would<lb/> likely be most reflective of the societal value of each health<lb/> state.<lb/></p>

			<head>Limitations<lb/></head>

			<p>In the SG task, there was a large range in the level of risk<lb/> that some adult respondents indicated they were willing to<lb/> accept, with some individuals suggesting they would will-<lb/>ingly accept 100% risk of death for a treatment which had<lb/> 0% chance of improving their health state. It is likely that,<lb/> for some adult respondents, there was some confusion about<lb/> the nature of the task and the ratings that they were making,<lb/> and that for others, they were simply completing the task<lb/> as quickly as possible and not giving the necessary con-<lb/>sideration to the task at hand. Moreover, the complexity of<lb/> some of the comorbid symptom profiles may have led to<lb/> some respondents not absorbing all aspects of the conditions<lb/> described. In particular, utility differences between ARC and<lb/> well-to-partly controlled asthma compared with ARC alone<lb/> were not very pronounced considering the differences in<lb/> the conditions described, and it is possible that features of<lb/> asthma were not attended to.<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly large ranges were observed in the child VAS<lb/> data, and in general utility values elicited in children were<lb/> much lower than those elicited in adults. It is likely that<lb/> children, with less experience or knowledge of the vast<lb/> array of health conditions that people can suffer from,<lb/> struggle to understand the scaling and, therefore, all esti-<lb/>mates for these health states were scaled down. Alterna-<lb/>tively, differences in the scores may be an artefact of using<lb/> different tasks in the adults and children, and indeed previ-<lb/>ous research has demonstrated elicitation of higher values<lb/> using SG methodology compared with VAS <ref type="biblio">[20, 21]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Exclusion of responses lower than 0.3 is likely to have<lb/> removed a large proportion of unthoughtful or confused<lb/> respondents, and randomisation of the order of health<lb/> state presentation across participants aimed to reduce<lb/> order effects, however, these issues may explain some of<lb/> the inconsistencies observed. Application of this exclu-<lb/>sion rule resulted in the exclusion of 659 children and<lb/> 219 adults, indicating that a substantial number of chil-<lb/>dren in particular, were providing responses that lacked<lb/> face validity, and highlighting the difficulties of conduct-<lb/>ing such studies in child populations. Sensitivity analyses<lb/> exploring the impact of using different exclusion criteria<lb/> are reported in Supplementary Material B, and conclude<lb/> that these criteria produced the best balance of includ-<lb/>ing maximal respondents while excluding the majority of<lb/> substandard data.<lb/></p>

			<p>In both the adult and child data, there were some small<lb/> differences in directions against expectations, however,<lb/> such differences would not be considered statistically dif-<lb/>ferent, and likely result from the fact that patients were<lb/> allocated a random 8 of the total 14 health states, there-<lb/>fore were not considering all conditions relative to one<lb/> another. Calculation of disutilities was conducted using<lb/> respondent-level data including only respondents who<lb/> had been presented with the two health states in question,<lb/> rather than at the aggregate level, in order to present more<lb/> consistent disutilities from individuals who had had the<lb/> opportunity to consider both states in question.<lb/></p>

			<p>Electronic administration is beneficial for allowing<lb/> fast collection of data from large samples, but, inevitably,<lb/> some of the nuances that occur in an interview setting are<lb/> lost. For example, individuals are likely to be less inclined<lb/> to reflect on their decision, while this may be encouraged<lb/> in an interview setting. Vignette studies are also limited in<lb/> that when asked to imagine they have an illness, partici-<lb/>pants often imagine the impact of the illness at the time<lb/> immediately following diagnosis, and respond to questions<lb/> accordingly, whereas patients often grow accustomed to<lb/> living with a condition and although their health utility<lb/> may be lower at disease onset, it commonly improves as<lb/> patients get used to the condition.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>This study provides utility and disutility values that can<lb/> be used in health economic models of new treatments for<lb/> AR/ARC and asthma. The disutility values calculated dem-<lb/>onstrate how increases in severity and morbidity reduce<lb/> HRQoL, and these findings, alongside research into other<lb/> chronic conditions, converge to emphasise that the impact<lb/> of ARC and associated conditions on patient HRQoL should<lb/> not be dismissed as inconsequential, and that treatments that<lb/> reduce symptom severity and risk of asthma onset are likely<lb/> to provide clinically meaningful utility gains.</p>
