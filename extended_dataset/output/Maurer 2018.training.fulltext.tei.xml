			<head>METHODS<lb/></head>

			<p>In a multicenter, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we<lb/> randomly assigned 441 patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in a 2:1:2<lb/> ratio to receive 80 mg of tafamidis, 20 mg of tafamidis, or placebo for 30 months.<lb/> In the primary analysis, we hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, followed by<lb/> frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations according to the Finkelstein-<lb/>Schoenfeld method. Key secondary end points were the change from baseline to<lb/> month 30 for the 6-minute walk test and the score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy<lb/> Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS), in which higher scores indicate better<lb/> health status.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/></head>

			<p>In the primary analysis, all-cause mortality and rates of cardiovascular-related hos-<lb/>pitalizations were lower among the 264 patients who received tafamidis than among<lb/> the 177 patients who received placebo (P&lt;0.001). Tafamidis was associated with lower<lb/> all-cause mortality than placebo (78 of 264 <ref type="biblio">[29.5%]</ref> vs. 76 of 177 [42.9%]; hazard ratio,<lb/> 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.96) and a lower rate of cardiovascular-<lb/>related hospitalizations, with a relative risk ratio of 0.68 (0.48 per year vs. 0.70 per year;<lb/> 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.81). At month 30, tafamidis was also associated with a lower rate of<lb/> decline in distance for the 6-minute walk test (P&lt;0.001) and a lower rate of decline<lb/> in KCCQ-OS score (P&lt;0.001). The incidence and types of adverse events were similar<lb/> in the two groups.<lb/></p>

			<p>T h e ne w e ngl a nd jou r na l o f m e dicine<lb/> T<lb/> ransthyretin amyloid cardiomy<lb/> opathy is a life-threatening disease charac-<lb/>terized by the accumulation of amyloid fi-<lb/>brils composed of misfolded transthyretin protein<lb/> in the heart. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> Misfolded monomers or oligomers<lb/> of transthyretin are deposited in the myocardium,<lb/> leading to cardiomyopathy and symptoms of heart<lb/> failure, including dyspnea, fatigue, orthostatic hy-<lb/>potension, and syncope. <ref type="biblio">2</ref> Infiltration of the con-<lb/>duction system can lead to bundle-branch block,<lb/> atrioventricular block, sinoatrial disease, and atrial<lb/> fibrillation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is a late-<lb/>onset disease; symptoms are predominately mani-<lb/>fested in male patients 60 years of age or older. <ref type="biblio">2<lb/></ref> The condition can be inherited as an autosomal<lb/> dominant trait caused by pathogenic mutations<lb/> in the transthyretin gene TTR (ATTRm) or by the<lb/> deposition of wild-type transthyretin protein<lb/> (ATTRwt), previously called senile systemic amy-<lb/>loidosis. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> There are more than 120 pathogenic<lb/> mutations in TTR that result in a variable pheno-<lb/>typic presentation. <ref type="biblio">2,3</ref> Although the prevalence of<lb/> ATTRwt is uncertain, studies that use an approach<lb/> to diagnosis that is not based on biopsy <ref type="biblio">4,5</ref> have<lb/> reported a prevalence of 13% among patients with<lb/> heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction, <ref type="biblio">6<lb/></ref> 16% among patients undergoing transcatheter<lb/> aortic-valve replacement for severe aortic steno-<lb/>sis, <ref type="biblio">7</ref> and 5% among patients with presumed hy-<lb/>pertrophic cardiomyopathy. <ref type="biblio">8</ref> Treatments have been<lb/> limited to supportive care, with no guideline-rec-<lb/>ommended treatment. Median survival in untreat-<lb/>ed patients is reported to be 2.5 years after diag-<lb/>nosis for ATTRm caused by the TTR Val122Ile<lb/> mutation and 3.6 years for ATTRwt. <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> Death in<lb/> most patients is from cardiac causes, including<lb/> sudden death and heart failure. <ref type="biblio">9<lb/></ref> Transthyretin is a 127-amino acid, 55-kD pro-<lb/>tein that is primarily synthesized in the liver and<lb/> transports thyroxine and retinol-binding protein-<lb/>retinol (vitamin A) complex. <ref type="biblio">11,12</ref> Fibrillogenesis oc-<lb/>curs when the tetrameric structure of the trans-<lb/>thyretin protein dissociates into intermediates,<lb/> which misassemble into soluble oligomers,<lb/> protofilaments, and amyloid fibrils. <ref type="biblio">13</ref> Kelly and<lb/> colleagues discovered that a polymorphism in<lb/> TTR that encodes the amino-acid substitution<lb/> Thr119Met stabilized the protein in the context<lb/> of a destabilizing pathogenic variant (Val30Met),<lb/> leading to the development of tafamidis, <ref type="biblio">14,15</ref> a<lb/> benzoxazole derivative lacking nonsteroidal anti-<lb/>inflammatory drug activity that binds to the thy-<lb/>roxine-binding sites of transthyretin with high af-<lb/>finity and selectivity and inhibits the dissociation<lb/> of tetramers into monomers. Tafamidis has been<lb/> shown to slow the progression of peripheral neu-<lb/>rologic impairment in transthyretin amyloid poly-<lb/>neuropathy. <ref type="biblio">16<lb/></ref> With respect to transthyretin amyloid cardio-<lb/>myopathy, a phase 2, open-label trial involving<lb/> 31 patients showed that tafamidis (20 mg daily)<lb/> stabilized transthyretin and had an acceptable<lb/> safety profile. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> A single-center, nonrandomized<lb/> study showed an association between tafamidis<lb/> and improved survival. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> The Transthyretin Amyloi-<lb/>dosis Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT) <ref type="biblio">19<lb/></ref> was designed to determine the efficacy and safety<lb/> of tafamidis in patients with hereditary and wild-<lb/>type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Me thods<lb/> Trial Oversight<lb/></head>

			<p>ATTR-ACT was a phase 3, multicenter, interna-<lb/>tional, parallel-design, placebo-controlled, double-<lb/>blind, randomized trial. Details of the trial have<lb/> been described previously. <ref type="biblio">19</ref> The trial was over-<lb/>seen by a steering committee that included inves-<lb/>tigators and the sponsor. ATTR-ACT was approved<lb/> by the independent review board or ethics com-<lb/>mittee at each participating site and was con-<lb/>ducted in accordance with the provisions of the<lb/> Declaration of Helsinki and the International<lb/> Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Prac-<lb/>tice guidelines. All patients provided written in-<lb/>formed consent. The trial was designed by the<lb/> sponsor in collaboration with clinicians with expe-<lb/>rience in the treatment of transthyretin amyloid<lb/> cardiomyopathy. Investigators collected and held<lb/> the data in a blinded fashion until the data were<lb/> analyzed centrally by the sponsor. An external<lb/> data and safety monitoring board was responsi-<lb/>ble for monitoring patient safety and conducted<lb/> unblinded reviews of cumulative trial data. An<lb/> independent, end-point adjudication committee,<lb/> whose members were also unaware of the trial-<lb/>group assignments, determined whether investi-<lb/>gator-reported events met the definition of dis-<lb/>ease-related efficacy end points with the use of<lb/> predefined end-point criteria, thereby maintain-<lb/>ing the scientific integrity of the trial. The sta-<lb/>tistical analysis was performed by the sponsor,<lb/> and data tables were provided to the investiga-<lb/></p>

The first author<lb/> wrote the first draft. All authors participated in<lb/> manuscript development and made the decision<lb/> to publish the results. Agreements between the<lb/> sponsor of the trial, Pfizer, and the investigators<lb/> included data confidentiality.<lb/> Patients<lb/> Patients between 18 and 90 years of age were<lb/> eligible to participate in ATTR-ACT if they had<lb/> transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt<lb/> or ATTRm) confirmed by the presence of amyloid<lb/> deposits on analysis of biopsy specimens obtained<lb/> from cardiac and noncardiac sites (e.g., fat aspi-<lb/>rate, gastrointestinal sites, salivary glands, or<lb/> bone marrow) and, in patients without ATTRm,<lb/> by the presence of transthyretin precursor pro-<lb/>tein confirmed on immunohistochemical analy-<lb/>sis, scintigraphy, or mass spectrometry. Cardiac<lb/> involvement was confirmed by means of echocar-<lb/>diography, with an end-diastolic interventricular<lb/> septal wall thickness exceeding 12 mm; a history<lb/> of heart failure, with at least one prior hospital-<lb/>ization for heart failure or clinical evidence of<lb/> heart failure (without hospitalization) manifested<lb/> in signs or symptoms of volume overload or ele-<lb/>vated intracardiac pressures requiring treatment<lb/> with a diuretic for improvement; an N-terminal<lb/> pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level<lb/> greater than or equal to 600 pg per milliliter; and<lb/> a 6-minute walk-test distance exceeding 100 m.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Patients were excluded if any one of the fol-<lb/>lowing criteria was met: they had, in the opinion<lb/> of the investigator, heart failure that was not due<lb/> to transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy; New<lb/> York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart<lb/> failure; the presence of light-chain amyloidosis;<lb/> a history of liver or heart transplantation; an im-<lb/>planted cardiac device; previous treatment with<lb/> tafamidis; an estimated glomerular filtration rate<lb/> lower than 25 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-<lb/>surface area; or liver transaminase levels exceed-<lb/>ing two times the upper limit of the normal range.<lb/> Patients were also excluded if they had severe<lb/> malnutrition as defined by a modified body-mass<lb/> index (mBMI) of less than 600, calculated as the<lb/> serum albumin level in grams per liter multiplied<lb/> by the conventional BMI (the weight in kilograms<lb/> divided by the square of the height in meters), or<lb/> were receiving concurrent treatment with non-<lb/>steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, tauroursode-<lb/>oxycholate, doxycycline, calcium-channel block-<lb/>ers, or digitalis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Trial Design<lb/></head>

			<p>Patients were randomly assigned to receive 80 mg<lb/> of tafamidis, 20 mg of tafamidis, or matching<lb/> placebo once daily in ratio of a 2:1:2. Stratifica-<lb/>tion was conducted according to TTR status (vari-<lb/>ant or wild type) and baseline NYHA class. An<lb/> interactive Web-response system was used. The<lb/> trial duration was 30 months, and on completion<lb/> patients were offered enrollment in an extension<lb/> study. Patients who had adverse events that may<lb/> have been associated with treatment and may have<lb/> affected adherence to the dosing regimen or con-<lb/>tinued participation in the trial were given the<lb/> option to receive a reduced dose (patients receiving<lb/> a dose of 80 mg would instead receive a dose of<lb/> 40 mg, and all others continued to receive the dose<lb/> assigned at randomization).<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis Populations<lb/></head>

			<p>The modified intention-to-treat analysis included<lb/> all patients who were enrolled, received at least<lb/> one dose of tafamidis or placebo, with both pa-<lb/>tient and investigator unaware of group assign-<lb/>ment, and underwent at least one postbaseline<lb/> efficacy evaluation (i.e., postbaseline hospital-<lb/>ization, study visit, or death). The safety analysis<lb/> set included all enrolled patients who received at<lb/> least one dose of tafamidis or placebo. Because<lb/> all patients who were enrolled also fulfilled the<lb/> three other criteria of the modified intention-to-<lb/>treat analysis, this analysis was effectively also an<lb/> intention-to-treat analysis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>We hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality,<lb/> followed by frequency of cardiovascular-related<lb/> hospitalizations over the course of the 30-month<lb/> trial. This analysis compared the results of a<lb/> pooled tafamidis (80 mg and 20 mg) treatment<lb/> group with the placebo group. Key secondary end<lb/> points were change from baseline to month 30 in<lb/> both distance walked on the 6-minute walk test, 20<lb/> a measure of functional capacity, and the Kansas<lb/> City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Sum-<lb/>mary (KCCQ-OS) score, <ref type="biblio">21</ref> which assesses quality<lb/> of life. Scores range from 0 to 100, with lower<lb/> scores denoting poorer quality of life. Vital status<lb/> at month 30 was assessed for all enrolled patients.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical Analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>A sample size of 400 patients was estimated to<lb/> give the trial power of at least 90% to detect a<lb/> 30% reduction in mortality, a reduction in the<lb/> frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitaliza-<lb/>tions from 2.5 to 1.5 (over the 30-month dura-<lb/>tion of the trial), or both given treatment with<lb/> tafamidis. Our trial population was targeted to<lb/> comprise at least 30% of patients with ATTRm<lb/> and at least 30% with ATTRwt. Comparisons were<lb/> based on the pooled tafamidis treatment groups of<lb/> 80 mg and 20 mg versus placebo, except for spe-<lb/>cific dose comparisons. In the primary analysis,<lb/> we hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, fol-<lb/>lowed by frequency of cardiovascular-related hos-<lb/>pitalizations with the use of the Finkelstein-<lb/>Schoenfeld method, <ref type="biblio">22</ref> which is based on the<lb/> principle that each patient in the clinical trial is<lb/> compared with every other patient within each<lb/> stratum in a pairwise manner. This method<lb/> gives a higher importance to all-cause mortality.<lb/> The pairwise comparison proceeds in hierarchi-<lb/>cal fashion, using all-cause mortality, followed by<lb/> frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitaliza-<lb/>tion when patients cannot be differentiated on<lb/> the basis of mortality. In the analysis of fre-<lb/>quency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization,<lb/> when two patients had different follow-up times,<lb/> the shorter follow-up time was used in compar-<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Randomization, Evaluation, and Outcomes.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The most common reasons that screened patients were not admitted to the trial were as follows: closure of enroll-<lb/>ment (for patients with wild-type transthyretin protein), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level less than<lb/> 600 pg per milliliter, clinical instability, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate lower than 25 ml per minute per<lb/> 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area. Among patients assigned to receive tafamidis who did not complete the trial, 25 were<lb/> no longer willing to participate, 17 had adverse events, 6 underwent organ transplantation, 2 had implantation of a<lb/> cardiac mechanical assist device (CMAD), 1 was lost to follow-up, and 1 had a protocol violation. Among patients<lb/> assigned to receive placebo, 37 were no longer willing to participate, 11 had an adverse event, 5 underwent organ<lb/> transplantation, and 1 had a protocol violation. Vital status at 30 months was available and confirmed for all pa-<lb/>tients who underwent randomization. The numbers shown do not depict the death count for the purpose of pri-<lb/>mary analysis. Some reasons for discontinuation (i.e., heart transplantation and CMAD implantation) were treated<lb/> as death in the primary analysis. The total number of actual deaths was 144.<lb/></p>

			<p>ing the frequency of their cardiovascular-related<lb/> hospitalizations.<lb/></p>

			<p>We applied the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method<lb/> to the patients stratified according to NYHA class<lb/> at baseline (class I or II vs. class III) and TTR<lb/> status (variant vs. wild-type), yielding four strati-<lb/>fication pools. Heart transplantation, heart and<lb/> liver transplantation, and implantation of a me-<lb/>chanical cardiac-assist device were treated as death<lb/> for the purposes of this analysis. Only one pa-<lb/>tient underwent liver transplantation alone, and<lb/> this event was not treated as a death. All-cause<lb/> mortality was analyzed with the use of a Cox<lb/> proportional-hazards model, with treatment and<lb/> the stratification factors treated as covariates.<lb/></p>

			<p>We compared the frequency of cardiovascular-<lb/>related hospitalizations with the use of a Poisson<lb/> regression model, with treatment, TTR status (vari-<lb/>ant and wild type), NYHA baseline class (NYHA<lb/> classes I and II combined vs. NYHA class III),<lb/> treatment-by-TTR status interaction, and treat-<lb/>ment-by-NYHA baseline class interaction terms as<lb/> factors, with adjustment for treatment duration.<lb/></p>

			<p>The key secondary end points were assessed with<lb/> the use of a mixed-effect model, repeated-mea-<lb/>sure approach and analysis of covariance, <ref type="biblio">23</ref> with<lb/> an unstructured covariance matrix. Center and<lb/> patient-within-center were treated as random ef-<lb/>fects, and treatment, visit, TTR status (ATTRm<lb/> vs. ATTRwt), and visit-by-treatment interaction<lb/> were treated as fixed effects, with the baseline<lb/> value as covariate. A prespecified hierarchical<lb/> testing order (the 6-minute walk test, followed<lb/> by the KCCQ-OS) provided multiplicity protec-<lb/>tion against type 1 error. The remaining second-<lb/>ary and exploratory analyses and end points were<lb/> not adjusted for multiplicity.<lb/></p>

Kaplan-Meier sur-<lb/>vival curves showed that tafamidis resulted in a<lb/> reduction in all-cause mortality, with the curves<lb/> diverging after approximately 18 months of treat-<lb/>ment (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Across prespecified subgroups, in-<lb/>cluding those based on TTR status (ATTRwt vs.<lb/> ATTRm), NYHA class (I or II vs. III), and tafam-<lb/>idis dose (80 mg vs. 20 mg), the difference in<lb/> all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovas-<lb/>cular-related hospitalizations favored tafamidis<lb/> over placebo, except in patients with NYHA class<lb/> III disease at baseline, among whom the rates of<lb/> cardiovascular-related hospitalizations were high-<lb/>er among patients receiving tafamidis than among<lb/> those receiving placebo (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Using a prespeci-<lb/>fied Poisson-regression analysis, we observed an<lb/> interaction between treatment and NYHA base-<lb/>line classification. We did not observe an inter-<lb/>action between treatment and TTR status. A pre-<lb/>specified sensitivity analysis of all-cause mortality<lb/> that did not treat transplantation involving heart<lb/> transplantation or implantation of a cardiac me-<lb/>chanical assist device as death yielded a hazard<lb/> ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.94). An additional<lb/> post hoc analysis of time to first cardiovascular-<lb/>related hospitalization is provided (see Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref> in<lb/> the Supplementary Appendix).<lb/> Key secondary end points included the change<lb/> from baseline to month 30 in the distance walked<lb/> during the 6-minute walk test and in KCCQ-OS<lb/> score. Tafamidis reduced the decline in the dis-<lb/>tance walked during the 6-minute test as com-<lb/>pared with placebo (75.68 m [standard error, ±9.24;<lb/> P&lt;0.001]), with differences first observed at<lb/> month 6 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>). Tafamidis also reduced the<lb/> decline in the KCCQ-OS score as compared with<lb/> placebo (13.65 [standard error, ±2.13; P&lt;0.001]),<lb/> with differences first observed at month 6 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Safety and Adverse Effects<lb/></head>

			<p>The safety profiles of tafamidis and placebo were<lb/> similar. There was no meaningful difference in<lb/> the safety of the two doses of tafamidis. Adverse<lb/> events that emerged during treatment were gen-<lb/>erally mild to moderate in severity, and perma-<lb/>nent discontinuation of tafamidis or placebo as<lb/> a result of adverse events was less common in<lb/> the tafamidis groups than in the placebo group<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref> in the Supplementary Appendix). Dose<lb/> reduction related to adverse events were uncom-<lb/>mon (two patients receiving tafamidis [0.8%] and<lb/> four patients receiving placebo [2.3%]). The results<lb/> of laboratory analyses related to safety did not<lb/> differ between the tafamidis and placebo groups.<lb/> Both diarrhea and urinary tract infections, ad-<lb/>verse events previously reported in patients with<lb/> familial amyloid polyneuropathy, <ref type="biblio">25</ref> were less com-<lb/>mon in patients who received tafamidis than in<lb/> those who received placebo. The most frequent<lb/> adverse events are summarized in the Supplemen-<lb/>tary Appendix.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>ATTR-ACT showed that tafamidis is superior to<lb/> placebo in reducing the combination of all-cause<lb/> mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitaliza-<lb/>tions. The evidence also supports the assertion<lb/> that the risk of each component, when analyzed<lb/> independently of the other, is reduced. Tafamidis<lb/> was also associated with a significant reduction<lb/> in the decline in functional capacity (as measured<lb/> by the 6-minute walk test) and the decline in<lb/> quality of life (as measured by the KCCQ-OS) at<lb/> month 30, with differences first observed at<lb/> 6 months. In contrast, the effect on overall sur-<lb/>vival emerged after approximately 18 months. This<lb/> dissociation between the effect on symptoms and<lb/> survival has also been observed with other thera-<lb/>pies for systolic heart failure in which ventricular<lb/> remodeling takes months to achieve. <ref type="biblio">26-28<lb/></ref> We observed a consistent benefit from tafam-<lb/>idis related to mortality across all subgroups. We<lb/> also observed fewer cardiovascular-related hos-<lb/>pitalizations among those who received tafamidis<lb/> across all subgroups, with the exception of those<lb/> with NYHA class III. We speculate that the high-<lb/>er hospitalization rate observed in this group is<lb/> attributable to longer survival during a more<lb/> severe period of disease, underscoring the im-<lb/>portance of early diagnosis and treatment of this<lb/> fatal, progressive disease, which can be difficult<lb/> to diagnose. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> Given the progressive nature of the<lb/> disease and the mechanism through which tafam-<lb/>idis reduces amyloidogenesis -by specifically<lb/></p>

			<p>stabilizing transthyretin tetramers -the drug is<lb/> expected to have greater benefit when adminis-<lb/>tered early in the disease course. <ref type="biblio">30<lb/></ref> When the trial was designed, tissue biopsy<lb/> was required for diagnosis, but an approach<lb/> without biopsy -in which technetium-labeled<lb/> bone scintigraphy tracing is used instead -has<lb/> been validated as a method for the identification<lb/> of patients. This approach is highly sensitive and<lb/> specific for the diagnosis of transthyretin amy-<lb/>loid cardiomyopathy <ref type="biblio">4,5,31</ref> and can detect amyloid<lb/> deposits before an increase in left ventricular<lb/> wall thickness or the clinical syndrome of heart<lb/> failure and a rise in cardiac biomarkers has oc-<lb/>curred. <ref type="biblio">32,33</ref> This method can even predict prog-<lb/>nosis. <ref type="biblio">5,34</ref> Early identification and treatment are<lb/> now more likely given the availability of effective<lb/> diagnostic tools and therapy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly, innovative methods are being de-<lb/>veloped and used for research in rare disease. In<lb/> studies of rare disease such as transthyretin amy-<lb/>loid cardiomyopathy, small patient populations<lb/> often limit recruitment and hinder the conduct of<lb/> randomized trials. The Finkelstein-Schoenfeld<lb/> method, used in this trial, is a validated technique<lb/> that increases the sensitivity and power of the<lb/> analysis of smaller cohorts and prioritizes the<lb/> importance of mortality while also addressing<lb/> morbidity.<lb/></p>

			<p>The overall incidence and type of adverse<lb/> events were similar in the tafamidis and placebo<lb/> groups. Discontinuation of the trial drug owing<lb/> to adverse events that occurred during treatment<lb/> was less common in patients who received ta-<lb/>famidis than in those who received placebo, and<lb/> dose reductions were uncommon and occurred<lb/> more often in the placebo group.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, in patients with heart failure<lb/> due to transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy,<lb/> treatment with tafamidis reduced all-cause mor-<lb/>tality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations<lb/> as compared with placebo. Tafamidis treatment<lb/> also significantly reduced the decline in func-<lb/>tional capacity and quality of life. These find-<lb/>ings indicate that tafamidis is an effective therapy<lb/> for patients with transthyretin amyloid cardio-<lb/>myopathy.</p>
