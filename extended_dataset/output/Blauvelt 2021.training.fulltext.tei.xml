			<p>A<lb/> topic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by a chronic and<lb/> relapsing nature, eczematous morphology, and intense<lb/> pruritus. <ref type="biblio">1,2</ref> It is driven by proinflammatory mediators,<lb/> such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-13, IL-22, IL-31, interferon gamma<lb/> (IFN-γ), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), that trans-<lb/>duce signals via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activa-<lb/>tor of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway. <ref type="biblio">3,4</ref> Dupilumab,<lb/> a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the shared<lb/> IL-4 receptor subunit α of IL-4 and IL-13 receptors, is approved<lb/> for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD; however, fewer than<lb/> half of patients achieve clear or almost clear skin after 16 weeks<lb/> of dupilumab monotherapy, with maximal responses achieved<lb/> after week 12. <ref type="biblio">5</ref> Thus, there is a need for additional treatment<lb/> options that provide improved clinical responses to a greater<lb/> proportion of patients and in a more rapid manner.<lb/></p>

			<p>Upadacitinib is an oral, reversible, small molecule JAK in-<lb/>hibitor engineered to have increased selectivity for JAK1 vs JAK2,<lb/> JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2, with the intention of improving ef-<lb/>ficacy and safety for an improved benefit-risk profile compared<lb/> with other, less-selective JAK inhibitors. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> Upadacitinib is ap-<lb/>proved in the United States, European Union, and other coun-<lb/>tries to treat moderately or severely active rheumatoid arthri-<lb/>tis, and is being developed for the treatment of AD and other<lb/> immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> Results from 1 phase<lb/> 2b <ref type="biblio">7</ref> and 3 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials (Measure Up 1, Measure<lb/> Up 2, and AD Up) <ref type="biblio">8,9</ref> demonstrated that once-daily upadacitinib<lb/> (15 or 30 mg) is a well-tolerated and effective treatment option<lb/> for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Here, we assess the<lb/> safety and efficacy of upadacitinib vs dupilumab in adults with<lb/> moderate-to-severe AD.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/> Study Design<lb/></head>

			<p>Heads Up (NCT03738397) was a 24-week, head-to-head, phase<lb/> 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy,<lb/> active-controlled clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy<lb/> of upadacitinib with dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-<lb/>severe AD. This clinical trial was conducted from February 21,<lb/> 2019, to December 9, 2020, at 129 centers located in 22 countries<lb/> across Europe, North and South America, Oceania, and the Asia-<lb/>Pacific region. Heads Up had a 35-day screening period, a 24-<lb/>week double-blinded treatment period, and a 12-week follow-up<lb/> visit or the option to enter an open-label upadacitinib extension<lb/> study. Independent ethics committees or institutional review<lb/> boards approved the trial protocol, informed consent form(s),<lb/> and recruitment materials before patient enrollment. This clinical<lb/> trial was conducted in accord with the International Conference<lb/> for Harmonisation guidelines, applicable regulations, and the<lb/> Declaration of Helsinki. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> Patients provided written informed<lb/> consent before screening. This study followed the Consolidated<lb/> Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline (trial protocol<lb/> in Supplement 1).<lb/></p>

			<head>Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>Eligible patients were adults aged 18 to 75 years with diag-<lb/>nosed AD using the Hanifin and Rajka criteria 11 who were can-<lb/>didates for systemic therapy (inadequate response to topical<lb/> treatments for AD, documented use of systemic treatment for<lb/> AD, or topical treatments for AD otherwise medically inadvis-<lb/>able) and who had moderate-to-severe disease (defined as<lb/> ≥10% of body surface area affected by AD, Eczema Area and<lb/> Severity Index [EASI] ≥16, validated Investigator&apos;s Global As-<lb/>sessment for AD score ≥3 at screening and baseline visits, and<lb/> weekly average Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [NRS]<lb/> score ≥4 at baseline). Prior use of JAK inhibitors or dupil-<lb/>umab was prohibited. eTable 1 in Supplement 2 has complete<lb/> patient eligibility criteria.<lb/></p>

			<head>Clinical Trial Procedures<lb/></head>

			<p>Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 30 mg of upadaci-<lb/>tinib via extended-release tablet administered orally once<lb/> daily until week 24 or 300 mg of dupilumab administered as<lb/> a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks after a loading dose<lb/> of 600 mg, starting at week 2 and until week 22 (eFigure 1 in<lb/> Supplement 2). Rescue therapy, defined as any topical or<lb/> systemic immunomodulatory treatment initiated for AD,<lb/> could be given at any time per investigator discretion.<lb/> Patients who received rescue therapy were considered non-<lb/>responders for binary end points after the initiation of<lb/> rescue therapy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Efficacy Parameters<lb/></head>

			<p>Efficacy was assessed as upadacitinib superiority compared<lb/> with dupilumab, with the primary end point being 75% im-<lb/>provement in EASI (EASI75) at week 16. Ranked secondary end<lb/> points were: percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruri-<lb/>tus NRS, achievement of EASI100 and EASI90 at week 16, per-<lb/>centage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS at week<lb/> 4, achievement of EASI75 at week 2, percentage change from<lb/> baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS at week 1, and Worst Pruritus<lb/> NRS improvement of 4 points or more at week 16. Additional<lb/> unranked end points were assessed at week 24, including<lb/> achievement of EASI75, EASI90, and EASI100, as well as im-<lb/>provement of 4 points or more in Worst Pruritus NRS. The Worst<lb/> Pruritus NRS end points were based on weekly averages of daily<lb/> pruritus scores. Dermatology Life Quality Index and Patient-<lb/>Oriented Eczema Measure data were not collected after base-<lb/>line in this study.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key Points<lb/></head>

			<p>Question Are the efficacy and safety of oral upadacitinib superior<lb/> to subcutaneous dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe<lb/> atopic dermatitis (AD)?<lb/> Findings This randomized, blinded, head-to-head comparator<lb/> clinical trial of 692 patients with moderate-to-severe AD<lb/> demonstrated clinically meaningful skin clearance and itch relief,<lb/> with statistically significant superiority for upadacitinib compared<lb/> with dupilumab. There were no new safety signals reported for<lb/> either upadacitinib or dupilumab.<lb/></p>

			<p>Meaning Upadacitinib provides superior and more rapid skin<lb/> clearance and itch relief with tolerable safety compared with<lb/> dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.<lb/></p>

			<head>Safety Parameters<lb/></head>

			<p>Safety was assessed as treatment-emergent adverse events<lb/> (TEAEs) in all patients who received 1 or more dose of study<lb/> drug through follow-up (30 days after the last dose of upa-<lb/>dacitinib or 84 days after the last dose of dupilumab); a TEAE<lb/> was defined as any adverse event (AE) that began or worsened<lb/> in severity after initiation of upadacitinib or dupilumab. All<lb/> AEs presented were treatment-emergent, unless otherwise<lb/> noted.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical Analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>Statistical analysis was conducted on an intent-to-treat basis.<lb/> The primary approach for evaluating categorical end points was<lb/> NRI-C (Nonresponder Imputation incorporating Multiple Im-<lb/>putation <ref type="biblio">[MI]</ref> to handle missing data due to COVID-19). The<lb/> initial NRI approach was revised to NRI-C because of the<lb/> COVID-19 pandemic, which may have prevented visits owing<lb/> to logistical restrictions; additional details regarding the NRI-C<lb/> approach are outlined in the eMethods in Supplement 2. Mul-<lb/>tiplicity-adjusted results were obtained via a hierarchical test-<lb/>ing procedure, controlling the overall type I error rate of all pri-<lb/>mary and ranked secondary end points at the 2-sided 0.05 level<lb/> (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/> Patient Disposition<lb/></head>

			<p>A total of 924 patients were screened, of whom 232 were ex-<lb/>cluded and 692 were enrolled and treated; 348 <ref type="biblio">(</ref></p>

183 men [52.6%];<lb/> mean [SD] age, 36.6 [14.6] years) received upadacitinib, and 344<lb/> (194 men [56.4%]; mean [SD] age, 36.9 [14.1] years) received du-<lb/>pilumab. The number of patients who discontinued treatment<lb/> was low overall; 316 (90.8%) completed upadacitinib treat-<lb/>ment, and 319 (92.7%) completed dupilumab treatment<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>); 336 patients (96.6%) completed 16 weeks of upadaci-<lb/>tinib treatment, and 328 patients (95.3%) completed 16 weeks<lb/> of dupilumab treatment. Eighty-seven upadacitinib-treated pa-<lb/>tients (25.0%) and 85 dupilumab-treated patients (24.7%) re-<lb/>ceived rescue therapy and were considered nonresponders for<lb/> visits after receiving rescue therapy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced<lb/> among the upadacitinib-treated and dupilumab-treated<lb/> groups, including key measures of disease activity: mean (SD)<lb/> EASI (30.8 [12.5] and 28.8 <ref type="biblio">[11.5]</ref>, respectively) and proportion<lb/> of patients with severe validated Investigator&apos;s Global Assess-<lb/>ment for AD (174 [50.0%] and 173 [50.3%], respectively)<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Efficacy Outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>The proportion of patients who achieved EASI75 at week 16<lb/> was significantly greater for patients receiving upadacitinib<lb/> than those receiving dupilumab (247 [71.0%] vs 210 [61.1%];<lb/> adjusted difference, 10.0% (95% CI, 2.9%-17.0%; P = .006)<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), thereby meeting the primary end point of EASI75 at<lb/> week 16 for superiority of upadacitinib compared with dupil-<lb/>umab. The response rate was calculated using the NRI-C<lb/> approach. The results based on NRI-C were consistent with<lb/> those based on NRI-NC (the traditional NRI approach), given<lb/> that the number of patients with missing values owing to<lb/> COVID-19 for the primary end point was low (1.6% [11 of 692])<lb/> (eTables 2 and 3 in Supplement 2). Most patients in both<lb/> treatment groups did not receive rescue therapy (eTable 4 in<lb/> Supplement 2).<lb/></p>

			<p>Onset of action was more rapid for upadacitinib, with the<lb/> proportion of patients achieving EASI75 at week 2 signifi-<lb/>cantly greater for those receiving upadacitinib compared with<lb/> those receiving dupilumab (152 of 348 [43.7%] vs 60 of 344<lb/> [17.4%]; P &lt; .001) (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Significantly greater proportions<lb/> of patients achieved high levels of efficacy (EASI90 and<lb/> EASI100) at week 16 with upadacitinib compared with dupi-<lb/>lumab (EASI90, 211 [60.6%] vs 133 [38.7%]; P &lt; .001; EASI100,<lb/> 97 [27.9%] vs 26 [7.6%]; P &lt; .001). The mean (SD) percentage<lb/> improvement from baseline Worst Pruritus NRS was signifi-<lb/>cantly greater for upadacitinib-treated patients compared with<lb/> dupilumab-treated patients as early as week 1 (31.4% [1.7%] vs<lb/> 8.8% [1.8%]; P &lt; .001) and week 4 (59.5% [2.2%] vs 31.7%<lb/> [2.2%]; P &lt; .001), and significant differences were main-<lb/>tained through week 16 (66.9% [1.9%] vs 49.0% [2.0%];<lb/> P &lt; .001). Furthermore, the proportion of patients achieving<lb/> a clinically meaningful improvement in itch (Worst Pruritus<lb/></p>

Thus, the study met all ranked sec-<lb/>ondary efficacy end points, demonstrating that upadaci-<lb/>tinib achieved significantly greater improvements in both<lb/> investigator-and patient-reported outcomes compared with<lb/> dupilumab.<lb/> Numerically greater proportions of upadacitinib-treated vs<lb/> dupilumab-treated patients achieved EASI75 as early as week 1<lb/> (55 of 348 [15.9%] vs 19 of 344 [5.5%]) and at week 4 (243 of 348<lb/> [69.9%] vs 123 of 344 [35.9%]) (Figure 2A). Similar differences<lb/> were observed for achievement of EASI90 at week 2 (64 of 348<lb/> [18.5%] vs 20 of 344 [5.8%]) and week 8 (206 of 48 [59.2%] vs 86<lb/> of 344 [25.1%]) (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). Positive differences between propor-<lb/>tions of upadacitinib-treated vs dupilumab-treated patients for<lb/> achievement of EASI100 were also observed at week 4 (29 of 348<lb/> [8.3%] vs 6 of 344 [1.7%]) and maintained through week 16 (97<lb/> of 348 [27.9%] vs 26 of 344 [7.6%]) (Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). In addition,<lb/> upadacitinib-treated patients had significantly greater reductions<lb/> than dupilumab-treated patients in mean (SE) Worst Pruritus NRS<lb/> as early as week 1 (−31.4% [1.7%] vs −8.8% [1.8%]) and maintained<lb/> through week 16 (−66.9% [1.9%] vs −49.0% [2.0%]) (Figure <ref type="figure">2D</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>A greater proportion of upadacitinib-treated than dupilumab-<lb/>treated patients achieved EASI75 (223 of 348 [64.2%] vs 205 of<lb/> 344 [59.5%]; P = .21 for upadacitinib vs dupilumab without ad-<lb/>justment for multiplicity) at week 24 (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).<lb/> In addition, EASI90 was achieved at week 24 by 194 of 348<lb/> upadacitinib-treated patients (55.6%) and EASI100 was achieved<lb/> at week 24 by 95 of 348 upadacitinib-treated patients (27.3%),<lb/> while EASI90 was achieved at week 24 by 164 of 344 dupilumab-<lb/>treated patients (47.6%; P = .04 for upadacitinib vs dupilumab<lb/> without adjustment for multiplicity) and EASI100 was achieved<lb/> at week 24 by 45 of 344 dupilumab-treated patients (13.1%; P &lt;<lb/> .001 for upadacitinib vs dupilumab without adjustment for mul-<lb/>tiplicity). Upadacitinib-treated patients also had greater improve-<lb/>ment from baseline in mean (SD) Worst Pruritus NRS than<lb/> dupilumab-treated patients at week 24 (63.1% [2.7%] vs 54.7%<lb/> [2.8%]; P = .03 for upadacitinib vs dupilumab without adjustment<lb/> for multiplicity).<lb/></p>

			<head>Safety Outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>The safety profile of upadacitinib in this study was consistent<lb/> with that observed in 1 phase 2b 7 and 3 pivotal phase 3 clini-<lb/>cal trials (Measure Up 1, Measure Up 2, and AD Up) <ref type="biblio">8,9</ref> (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>No new safety risks of upadacitinib were observed in this AD<lb/> study compared with other AD studies. The 16-week inci-<lb/>dence rates of TEAEs were 71.6% in upadacitinib-treated pa-<lb/>tients (249 of 348) and 62.8% in dupilumab-treated patients<lb/> (216 of 344). The rates of serious TEAEs and AEs leading to<lb/> study drug discontinuation were 2.9% (10 of 348) and 2.0% (7<lb/> of 348) for upadacitinib and 1.2% (4 of 344) and 1.2% (4 of 344)<lb/> for dupilumab, respectively. One death due to influenza-<lb/>associated bronchopneumonia was reported in a 40-year-old<lb/> upadacitinib-treated patient.<lb/></p>

			<p>Through 16 weeks of treatment, the most frequently re-<lb/>ported AE among patients treated with upadacitinib was acne<lb/> (55 [15.8%]), whereas acne was reported by 9 patients treated<lb/> with dupilumab (2.6%) (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). All acne events were mild or<lb/> moderate in severity, primarily involved the face and trunk, and<lb/> did not result in scarring; none led to study drug discontinua-<lb/>tion. The most frequently reported AE among patients treated<lb/> with dupilumab was conjunctivitis (29 [8.4%]), whereas con-<lb/>junctivitis was reported by 5 patients treated with upadacitinib<lb/> (1.4%). All conjunctivitis cases were mild or moderate in sever-<lb/>ity, and none led to study drug discontinuation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Among AEs of special interest, rates of serious infection (4<lb/> [1.1%] vs 2 [0.6%]), eczema herpeticum (1 [0.3%] vs 0%), and her-<lb/>pes zoster (7 [2.0%] vs 3 [0.9%]) were numerically higher for pa-<lb/>tients treated with upadacitinib than those treated with<lb/> dupilumab, all at generally low levels (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Each of the se-<lb/>rious infections was reported in a single patient. No eczema her-<lb/>peticum or herpes zoster event was considered to be serious. All<lb/> herpes zoster events were mild or moderate in severity, and none<lb/> led to study drug discontinuation. Most herpes zoster events in-<lb/>volved a single dermatome; 2 herpes zoster events involved 3<lb/> or more dermatomes, and 1 had ophthalmic involvement (peri-<lb/>orbital skin) in the upadacitinib group.<lb/></p>

			<p>The rate of hepatic disorders was higher among patients<lb/> treated with upadacitinib than those treated with dupil-<lb/>umab (10 [2.9%] vs 4 [1.2%]) (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Most of the hepatic<lb/> disorders were transaminase elevations that were mild or<lb/> moderate in severity, transient, and reported as singular<lb/></p>

There was a<lb/> single event of thrombocytopenia (grade 1 in severity)<lb/> reported in a patient treated with upadacitinib. Most of<lb/> these laboratory test-related AEs were mild or moderate in<lb/> severity, transient, and reported as singular abnormalities<lb/> without recurrence, with only 1 event deemed serious (de-<lb/>creased hemoglobin reported in the dupilumab-treated<lb/> group); none of these events led to study drug discontinua-<lb/>tion. No drug-induced liver injury or rhabdomyolysis events<lb/> were reported.<lb/></p>

			<p>One case of malignant neoplasm was reported in each<lb/> treatment group: 1 breast carcinoma in a 68-year-old<lb/> upadacitinib-treated patient (after week 16; eTable 6 in<lb/> Supplement 2) and 1 keratoacanthoma in a 69-year-old<lb/> dupilumab-treated patient. No cases of adjudicated venous<lb/> thromboembolic events, major adverse cardiovascular<lb/> events, active tuberculosis, or gastrointestinal perforation<lb/> were reported in either treatment group. Safety data through<lb/> the end of the monitoring period are summarized in eTable 6<lb/> in Supplement 2.<lb/></p>

			<p>Five nonserious cases of COVID-19 were reported during<lb/> the study-4 in the upadacitinib group and 1 in the dupil-<lb/>umab group. Treatment was temporarily interrupted for 3 upa-<lb/>dacitinib patients and resumed after resolution of the infec-<lb/>tion. Treatment was not interrupted for the fourth upadacitinib<lb/> patient or the dupilumab patient.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>To our knowledge, Heads Up is the first study directly com-<lb/>paring upadacitinib with dupilumab for AD and is now the<lb/> sixth clinical trial examining upadacitinib for the indication.<lb/> This study met the primary end point of EASI75 at week 16<lb/> and all ranked secondary end points, demonstrating superi-<lb/>ority of upadacitinib vs dupilumab for the treatment of<lb/> adults with moderate-to-severe AD. The most significant dif-<lb/>ferences between upadacitinib and dupilumab were in the<lb/> rapidity of onset and the ability to better achieve high levels<lb/> of skin clearance (eg, EASI90 and EASI100). At week 24,<lb/> upadacitinib-treated patients continued to show numerically<lb/> better results compared with dupilumab-treated patients for<lb/> measures of skin clearance and itch relief. Upadacitinib was<lb/> generally safe and well tolerated with no new safety risks<lb/> observed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite the approval of dupilumab in recent years, there<lb/> remains an unmet need for therapies that provide better effi-<lb/>cacy outcomes, such as clear or almost clear skin, for<lb/> patients with moderate-to-severe AD.

			<p>achieving EASI90 and EASI100 at week 16, reported here<lb/> and elsewhere, <ref type="biblio">7-9</ref> may become important regarding future<lb/> AD treatment goals. A similar shift has occurred in recent<lb/> years with the treatment of patients with another chronic<lb/> inflammatory skin disease, psoriasis, where treatment suc-<lb/>cess shifted from 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and<lb/> Severity Index to 90% and 100% improvement (PASI90 and<lb/> PASI100, respectively). As the effectiveness of new drugs for<lb/> psoriasis have improved, the higher relative improvement<lb/> scores PASI90 and PASI100 have become the benchmark for<lb/> systemic therapies, and we expect to see a similar trend in<lb/> AD treatment benchmarks.<lb/></p>

			<p>Treatment effect (including skin and itch improvement)<lb/> was also experienced more rapidly with upadacitinib com-<lb/>pared with dupilumab. Statistically significant skin improve-<lb/>ment as measured by EASI75 was attained as early as week 2<lb/> with upadacitinib, and significantly higher rates of clinically<lb/> meaningful improvements in itch were reported as early as<lb/> week 1. It is well established that patients prefer treatments<lb/> with a rapid onset of action. <ref type="biblio">13-15</ref> Upadacitinib-treated patients<lb/> achieved significantly higher rates of the stringent skin<lb/> improvement thresholds EASI90 and EASI100 compared with<lb/> dupilumab.<lb/></p>

			<p>Several key inflammatory cytokines are involved in the<lb/> pathogenesis of AD signal via JAK1, including IL-4 and IL-13<lb/> (epidermal barrier dysfunction), IL-22 (epidermal hyperpro-<lb/>liferation), IL-31 (itch neuron stimulation), IFN-γ (lesion chro-<lb/>nicity), and TSLP (T H 2 cell differentiation). <ref type="biblio">3,4,16</ref> Dupilumab tar-<lb/>gets the shared IL-4 and IL-13 receptor. By selectively inhibiting<lb/> JAK1, upadacitinib abrogates the signaling of a wider range of<lb/> proinflammatory mediators, including IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, IL-<lb/>31, IFN-γ, and TSLP. The simultaneous inhibition of multiple<lb/> pathways may contribute to the efficacy and rapidity effects<lb/> of upadacitinib compared with dupilumab.<lb/></p>

			<p>The safety profile of upadacitinib in this study was con-<lb/>sistent with that noted in 1 phase 2b trial 7 and 3 pivotal<lb/> phase 3 clinical trials (Measure Up 1, Measure Up 2, and AD<lb/> Up), <ref type="biblio">8,9</ref> with no new safety risks observed. In contrast to pre-<lb/></p>

			<p>vious studies of JAK inhibitors in patients with rheumatoid<lb/> arthritis, higher rates of acne were reported in studies of upa-<lb/>dacitinib in patients with AD. Of note, acne has also been<lb/> among the most frequently reported TEAEs for other JAK<lb/> inhibitors in AD (abrocitinib and baricitinib); the mechanism<lb/> underlying this AE is unclear. <ref type="biblio">17-19</ref> The rate of study drug dis-<lb/>continuation secondary to AEs was numerically higher with<lb/> upadacitinib. Rates of serious infection, eczema herpeticum,<lb/> herpes zoster, and laboratory test-related AEs were numeri-<lb/>cally higher with upadacitinib, while the rates of conjunc-<lb/>tivitis and injection-site reactions were numerically higher<lb/> with dupilumab. No venous thromboembolic events, major<lb/> adverse cardiovascular events, or gastrointestinal perfora-<lb/>tions were reported with either treatment. Overall, these<lb/> observations were consistent with the known safety profile<lb/> of each drug.<lb/></p>

			<head>Limitations<lb/></head>

			<p>This study has some limitations. The data reported here are<lb/> results through 24 weeks of treatment, with primary and<lb/> ranked secondary end points at week 16. Longer-term data are<lb/> being collected in a separate open-label extension study. Al-<lb/>though not necessarily a limitation, this study evaluated both<lb/> upadacitinib and dupilumab as monotherapy treatments, and<lb/> patients who received any topical agent as rescue therapy were<lb/> treated as nonresponders after receipt of rescue therapy. In real-<lb/>world practice, many patients use systemic therapies in com-<lb/>bination with topical therapies <ref type="biblio">20</ref> ; concomitant use of topical<lb/> corticosteroids is addressed in a separate study of upadaci-<lb/>tinib for AD. <ref type="biblio">9<lb/></ref> To maintain blinding, the monotherapy treatments of oral<lb/> upadacitinib and subcutaneous dupilumab were each accom-<lb/>panied by a placebo for the opposite therapy, but there was no<lb/> comparison against placebo as tested in the pivotal studies of<lb/> these treatments. When dupilumab, 300 mg every 2 weeks,<lb/> was given as monotherapy in SOLO1 and SOLO2, 51% and 44%<lb/> of patients, respectively, achieved EASI75 at week 16 when<lb/> compared with 15% and 12% for placebo, respectively. <ref type="biblio">5</ref> Higher<lb/> response rates for dupilumab may have been observed in the<lb/> present study owing to the lack of a placebo comparator and<lb/> subsequent responder or efficacy assessor bias. However, this<lb/> potential bias did not seem to impact response rates in the upa-<lb/>dacitinib group; in the upadacitinib placebo-controlled mono-<lb/>therapy studies, Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2, 79.7% and<lb/> 72.9% of patients treated with upadacitinib, 30 mg once daily,<lb/> achieved EASI75 at week 16, respectively, compared with 16.3%<lb/> and 13.3% for placebo, respectively. <ref type="biblio">8<lb/></ref></p>

 Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>Overall, upadacitinib was well tolerated and provided supe-<lb/>rior efficacy compared with dupilumab after 16 weeks of treat-<lb/>ment in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Upadacitinib<lb/> achieved higher levels of skin clearance and itch relief with a<lb/> more rapid onset of action vs dupilumab. Upadacitinib is an<lb/> effective treatment option for patients with moderate-to-<lb/>severe AD and may help inform future treatment decisions.<lb/></p>
