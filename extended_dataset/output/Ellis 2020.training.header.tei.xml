	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: The Allergy Patient Identification for Immunotherapy (AsPIRe) program was a parallel physician and<lb/> patient survey. The objectives were to examine physician and patient perceptions of seasonal allergy symptoms<lb/> and their impact on patients, and to examine patient and physician attitudes to allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for<lb/> seasonal allergies. AsPIRe was led by a steering committee and received research ethics board clearance from Queen&apos;s<lb/> University.<lb/> Methods: Allergists (17) from across Canada enrolled in the AsPIRe program and completed an on-line survey<lb/> to collect demographic information and baseline perceptions. Allergists then recruited patients and completed<lb/> paper-based parallel physician and patient questionnaires. Patients received an AIT informational booklet with their<lb/> questionnaire. Patients who were AIT-naïve with no contraindication to AIT and 12 years of age and older met the<lb/> inclusion criteria.<lb/> Results: The survey was in field from February 2018 to June 2018. A total of 141 allergist surveys and 136 patient<lb/> surveys were completed. Mean age of patients was 30 years old (range 12-70). Fifty-seven percent of patients<lb/> reported prior knowledge of AIT. Seventy-two percent of patients reported seasonal allergies of longer than 5 years<lb/> duration and in this subset of patients, 46% were at their first allergist visit. Seventy-three percent of all patients<lb/> indicated they would be likely or very likely to try sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), if recommended by their allergist<lb/> compared to 36% for subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). Conversely, 10% of patients reported they would be<lb/> unlikely or very unlikely to try SLIT compared to 46% of patients who would be unlikely or very unlikely to try SCIT if<lb/> recommended by their allergist.<lb/> Conclusions: In this particular study cohort, there was a gap in perception between allergists and their patients as<lb/> to the impact of allergy symptoms on daily life. Patients reported being more frequently impacted vs. their physician&apos;s<lb/> assessment. When asked about preference for AIT options, Canadian patients reported they were more likely to follow<lb/> their allergists&apos; recommendation for initiation of SLIT compared to SCIT.<lb/></div>
