	<div type="abstract">Background: The total naso-ocular symptom score (TSS) is widely used as an endpoint to evaluate the<lb/> severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, it is not a generic preference-based measure. We sought to<lb/> develop an algorithm for mapping between the TSS and health utility in Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP).<lb/> We also performed a cost-utility analysis of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for JCP by using this<lb/> algorithm.<lb/> Methods: Patients with JCP filled out the TSS questionnaire and EQ-5D-5L simultaneously during the<lb/> pollen season in 2019 and in 2020. We estimated a direct utility mapping model by regressing responses<lb/> to individual TSS questions directly onto utility. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of active<lb/> SLIT to a placebo was determined by examining the drug expense and the estimated quality-adjusted life<lb/> year (QALY) using a dataset from a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.<lb/> Results: A total of 238 records were included for analysis. The estimated utility decreased with increasing<lb/> severity of rhinitis. Patients with comorbid asthma showed lower utility. A negative and significant<lb/> correlation was seen between the TSS and utility in both 2019 and 2020. The estimated equations were:<lb/> Y(utility) ¼ À0.0161*X(TSS) þ 1.005 in non-asthmatic JCP patients. The ICER of active SLIT to the placebo<lb/> was estimated to be 4,049,720 and 6,011,218 JPY/QALY in the first and second year, respectively.<lb/> Conclusions: It is possible to reasonably predict utility from the total naso-ocular symptom score by using<lb/> regression models. In the estimated algorithm, pre-seasonal SLIT for JCP is cost-effective.<lb/></div>
