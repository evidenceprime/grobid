An Exploratory Cross-sectional Study of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and 

Immuno-related Adverse Events: 

Knowledge and Influencing Factors among Japanese Oncology Nurses 

Abstract 

Objective: Adequate knowledge of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and associated 

immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is essential for managing such events. However, the level 

of knowledge among Japanese nurses remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the 

current status of ICIs and irAE knowledge and the factors influencing them, among outpatient 

nurses caring for patients undergoing ICI treatment. 

Methods: An exploratory cross-sectional study was conducted at 450 facilities nationwide. 

Participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire consisting of three parts, 

measuring personal and environmental attributes and awareness and knowledge of irAEs. 

Questions were based on multiple literature sources and were evaluated and validated by medical 

oncologists and certified oncology nurses. 

Results: A total of 196 (response rate: 36%) nurses responded to the survey at 109 facilities 

(valid responses: 192; rate: 35%). The correct response rate was 27.6% for questions on general 

ICI knowledge and 15.6% for general irAE knowledge. Questions on pulmonary dysfunction had 

the highest correct response rate (41.7%), while those on neuromuscular/joint dysfunction had 

the lowest (1%). The mean correct response rates were 76% for general knowledge and 48.1% 

for ICI-specific knowledge. Multiple regression analysis showed that the most influential factor 

was participants' study schedule (p<.05). 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


Conclusions: There is room for nurses to acquire additional knowledge about ICIs and irAEs. 

The use of patient education tools and a study schedule significantly increased knowledge scores. 

Further research is needed to identify when and how to provide nurses with opportunities to 

acquire additional ICI and irAE-related knowledge. 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


1. Introduction 

Cancer has been the leading cause of mortality in Japan since 1981, causing 

approximately 380,000 deaths per year in 2020. 1 However, the five-year relative survival rate has 

exceeded 60% since 2009. 2 

Approaches to cancer treatment have also been changing in Japan. The number of 

domestic outpatients with malignant neoplasms now exceeds the number of inpatients, a trend 

that has increased in recent years. 3 This change is due to a variety of factors currently occurring 

in Japan, including the limited number of beds available at inpatient facilities, the promotion of 

home care, and advances in cancer drug therapy. 

Oncology pharmacotherapy is diversifying with the introduction of cytotoxic anticancer 

agents, molecular targeted agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), all of which have 

completely different mechanisms from conventional immunotherapy. 4-8 As of 2019, three ICIs 

had either been approved or were undergoing clinical trials in Japan: CTLA-4 inhibitors, PD-1 

inhibitors, and PD-L1 inhibitors. These have since been approved for nine types of cancer, 4 and 

clinical trials with these ICIs are being conducted for more than 25 cancer types. These trials are 

expected to result in additional indications for many cancer types and stages. 

The mode of action behind immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by ICI therapy 

remains unknown. It is also unclear why some patients experience irAEs, while others do not. 

Managing irAEs is different from managing the side effects of cytotoxic anticancer drug therapy. 

This is because irAEs appear in various forms and can, theoretically, occur anywhere in the 

body. Moreover, it is difficult to predict when they will appear, and delays in appropriate 

response and treatment can be fatal. 4,9,10 However, there is no established treatment or supportive 

care beyond the use of steroids. 4 Additionally, recent studies have shown that the risk of 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


mortality and disease progression is reduced when irAEs occur. 11,12 Thus, recognizing and 

managing irAEs is a critical factor for ensuring that patients continue to receive the treatment 

they require. 

Against this background, nurses must have adequate knowledge of ICI treatment and any 

associated irAEs. 13 However, although nurses must possess knowledge related to the medications 

used for each patient, their actual acquisition of such knowledge remains insufficient. 14,15 

According to the results of a survey of 160 nurses involved in clinical practice and education in 

various fields, nurses are aware of the need to provide nursing care based on evidence-based 

knowledge; however, they have difficulty translating this knowledge into practice. 16 

As ICI therapy is likely to become a mainstream cancer treatment in the near future, nurses 

need to acquire knowledge about ICI therapy and irAEs. However, the current status of nurses' 

knowledge about ICIs and irAEs and the recognition of their importance in Japan have not yet 

been clarified. Furthermore, globally, there is no research or questionnaire assessing ICI and 

irAE knowledge. At present, supportive care for adverse events associated with ICI therapy has 

not been established. As such, it is vital for nurses to have appropriate knowledge regarding 

irAEs to ensure early detection and treatment, thereby reducing distress among patients and their 

families. An appropriate level of knowledge is also needed to ensure that effective treatment can 

be safely continued and sufficient therapeutic effects are realized. 

This study aimed to test the following research hypotheses by examining knowledge of 

ICIs and irAEs-and the factors affecting that knowledge-among outpatient nurses involved in 

the care of patients undergoing ICI treatment in Japan. This study seeks to contribute to the field 

by analyzing the hypotheses based on a conceptual diagram of knowledge, attributes, and 

awareness of irAEs (Figure). Since no theoretical framework existed, the conceptual diagram 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


was originally schematized by the author. Knowledge of ICIs and irAEs is associated with 

personal attributes and environmental characteristics. Awareness of irAEs is associated with 

personal attributes, environmental characteristics, and knowledge of ICIs and irAEs. Personal 

attributes are in turn associated with environmental characteristics. 

Hypothesis 1: Nurses who study ICIs and irAEs gain adequate knowledge compared to 

those who do not. 

Hypothesis 2: Knowledge of ICIs and irAEs among nurses involved in ICI treatment 

would be associated with nurses' personal attributes, such as irAE management training 

participants, providing opportunities for learning about irAEs, and the number of ICI-

administered patients involved in care to date. A null hypothesis will be tested to the effect that 

there is no association between knowledge of irAEs and nurses' personal attributes, such as irAE 

management training participants, providing opportunities for learning about irAEs, and the 

number of ICI-administered patients involved in care. 

Hypothesis 3: Knowledge of ICIs and irAEs among nurses involved in ICI treatment 

would be associated between two groups of nurses' environmental characteristics, such as the 

presence of an in-house multidisciplinary team, certified cancer-related personnel, and an ICI-

specific questionnaire in the facility. A null hypothesis will be tested to the effect that there is no 

association between knowledge of irAEs and nurses' environmental characteristics, such as the 

presence of an in-house multidisciplinary team, certified cancer-related personnel, and an ICI-

specific questionnaire in the facility. 

2. Methods 

2.1 Design 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


This was an exploratory cross-sectional study using an internet-based self-administered 

questionnaire. 

2.2 Setting 

A total of 450 facilities in Japan were included in this study, including 447 designated 

comprehensive cancer centers and 86 advanced treatment hospitals that do not overlap with the 

designated comprehensive cancer centers. 17,18 

A research request letter, a sample questionnaire, a sample research cooperation request 

form for cooperating nurses, and a reply-paid postcard were sent to the head of the nursing 

department of the facility where the survey was conducted. The return postcards were sent by the 

head of the nursing department of the facility where the survey was to be conducted, with the 

name of the person in charge of accepting the survey and the number of possible collaborators 

indicated. Based on the returned postcards, a "Request for Research Cooperation Form" was 

mailed to the person in charge of accepting the survey at facilities that agreed to cooperate. The 

form included the purpose of the study and the URL and 2D code to access the Internet survey 

for the cooperating nurses. The research coordinator distributed this form to nurses who were 

involved in ICI administration nursing in the outpatient chemotherapy centers and outpatient 

treatment centers of gastroenterology and respiratory medicine, or similar departments, and 

requested their responses via the Internet. 

The data collection period was from June to September 2020. 

2.3 Participants 

The survey targets were nurses working in departments involved in the care of patients 

undergoing ICI treatment at the concerned facilities. The survey did not ask whether participants 

held certifications, such as certified cancer chemotherapy nursing or cancer nursing specialist in 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


oncology. 

2.4 Sample Size Calculation 

The total number of items calculated for the sample size was 35, which included 10 main 

attribute items from the 26 attribute items considered and selected to be particularly influential 

on irAE management, eight awareness items (7 questions and 1 free comment), nine items 

testing knowledge about ICIs and irAEs, and eight items on the various types of irAEs. The 

required minimum sample size was set at 175, five times the number of items. 19 Assuming that 

the response rate will be 25%, the number of required participants was calculated to be 700 

(=175/0.25). The number of facilities requested was calculated to be 281 (=70/0.25) assuming a 

minimum of 70 facilities and a response rate of 25%, based on the assumption that 10 nurses 

from one facility would respond to the survey. 

2.5 Questionnaire 

2.5.1 Test of ICI and irAE Knowledge 

Questions related to basic knowledge of ICIs and irAEs were based on the Cancer 

Immunotherapy Guidelines (second edition), 4 National Comprehensive Cancer Network 

guidelines, 6 and previous studies. 8,17,18.20-26 The survey consisted of ten items meant to extract 

participants' basic knowledge about ICIs and irAEs, specific symptoms of irAEs by area, 

frequency of occurrence, severity (mortality rate), and urgency as well as specific symptom 

measures and non-steroidal treatment. Knowledge scores were based on whether participants 

answered the true/false questions correctly. 

Nine oncologists, pulmonary physicians, oncology certificated nurse specialists, and 

certified cancer chemotherapy nurses were asked to evaluate the content validity of the ICI and 

irAE knowledge test in terms of appropriateness, difficulty, necessity, and modifications. The 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


appropriateness, difficulty, and necessity of each item were rated on a three-point Likert-type 

scale (3, high; 2, neither; 1, low); the mean scores were 2.4, 2.1, and 2.7, respectively. 

Modifications were made based on these results. 

A pilot survey of the modified ICI and irAE knowledge test was conducted with three 

nurses working at a designated comprehensive cancer center. The items were then re-examined 

and finalized. 

2.5.2 Awareness of irAEs 

Eight questions related to irAE awareness were set by referring to the item on side effects 

in the "31 items of nursing practice for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy," 14 replacing 

chemotherapy and its associated side effects with ICIs and irAEs, respectively. The response 

format was a five-point Likert scale. 

The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) 27 was applied to set up the answers for question 7, 

"plan to learn about irAEs." 

2.5.3 Attributes (Personal Attributes and Environmental Characteristics) 

A total of 26 items were asked based on multiple sources, including 20 items related to 

personal attributes and six related to environmental characteristics that are considered influential 

in the acquisition of cancer care expertise. Participants were asked to select applicable items or 

write freely. 

2.6 Data Analysis 

We performed a variance, correlation coefficient, and multiple regression analysis with 

attributes (personal attributes and environmental characteristics) and awareness of irAEs (7 

questions and 1 free comment) as the independent variables and irAE knowledge test scores as 

the dependent variable. 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


The knowledge test score was calculated as one point for each of the 41 questions in the 

ten domains, resulting in a total of 41 points for the knowledge test score. Additionally, each of 

the irAE question options (Q3 through Q10: total 32 options) was divided into two categories 

(except Q1 and Q2, which were ICI-related questions): knowledge required for general cancer 

nursing (12 options) and knowledge required for nursing specific to ICI (20 options), with one 

point each for a total of 32 points. The average percentage of correct answers was calculated. 

SPSS Statistics version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for analysis, and the 

significance level was set at .05%. 

In accordance with the hypothesis, the knowledge test scores on ICIs and irAEs were used 

as the dependent variable and the other variables were used as independent variables to examine 

the influencing factors. 

2.7 Ethical Considerations 

This study was conducted after obtaining approval from the Research Ethics Review 

Committee of an international university (approval no. 20-A018). All participants provided 

written informed consent. 

3. Results 

3.1 The Number of Survey Participants and Response Rate 

We sent a letter in advance to 281 nurse directors at the target facilities, which were 

randomly selected from 450 eligible facilities, requesting their participation. Nurse directors 

approached nurses who were involved in ICI administration nursing in the outpatient department, 

where cancer patients with indications for ICIs are treated. We sent 538 request letters to 109 

facilities (63%) that agreed to cooperate (38%). We received responses from 196 (36%), and 192 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


valid responses were obtained (valid response rate: 35%). Table 1 summarizes the basic 

attributes of the participants. 

3.2 General Data 

Table 1 summarizes the basic attributes of the participants. 

3.3 Nurses` Knowledge Level 

Table 2 presents the results of the ICI and irAE knowledge test. The mean score was 26.2 

out of 41 (63.9% correct, standard deviation (SD) 5.48), and the median score was 26.5. Among 

the individual questions, nine questions on ICI and irAE general knowledge were excluded 

because they combined the two types of knowledge, preventing individual measurement of ICI-

and irAE-specific knowledge. The remaining questions were divided into ICI-or irAE-specific 

knowledge (20 questions, "a" in Table 2) and general knowledge necessary for cancer nursing 

(12 questions, "b" in Table 2). The average percentage of correct answers for general knowledge 

of cancer nursing was higher than the average percentage of total correct answers, while the 

average percentage of correct answers for ICI-specific knowledge was lower. This was also true 

for the percentage of correct answers for each of the irAE topics; the percentage of correct 

answers was higher for the general knowledge questions and lower for the questions with more 

ICI-specific options. The irAE topics that exceeded the average percentage of correct answers for 

all questions were pulmonary dysfunction (41.7%) and hepatic dysfunction (27.1%). The 

reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) for the knowledge test was 0.79. 

3.4 Influencing Factors: Single Factor Analysis 

3.4.1 Personal Attributes and Environmental Characteristics Associated with Knowledge 

Test Scores 

The relationships between the knowledge test scores and the nominal variables of personal 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


attributes and environmental characteristics are shown in Table 3. The significant personal 

attributes were the number of beds, current department, certification held, highest level of 

nursing educational background, academic society affiliation, participation in irAE management 

training, experience with currently predictable irAEs, experience with currently unpredictable 

irAEs, existence of free self-study, existence of paid self-study, and affiliation with ICI-related 

multidisciplinary teams in the hospital. The significant environmental characteristics were the 

presence of certified personnel in the hospital, use of an ICI-specific questionnaire, and presence 

of a patient education tool (p < .05). 

The continuous variables of personal attributes and environmental characteristics that were 

correlated with ICI and irAE knowledge test scores by correlation coefficients were significantly 

different by years of experience in cancer nursing, number of certifications held, number of 

academic society affiliations, number of free self-study opportunities/modes, number of paid 

self-study opportunities/modes, number of in-hospital certified personnel, number of irAE 

confirmation tools, and number of patient education tools. The correlation coefficients were 

weak, ranging from 0.2 to 0.4. 

The ICI and irAE knowledge test scores for irAE management training participants were 

significantly higher, with a mean score of 28.5 (SD 4.80) and a median score of 29, than the 

scores of participants who had not participated in such training. 

In terms of the mean and median scores for the number of self-learning 

opportunities/modes, there was a difference in scores between the "free" group with two or fewer 

opportunities/modes and the "paid" group with three or more opportunities/modes. There was 

also a difference between the paid group with one or no opportunities/modes and the paid group 

with two or more opportunities/modes. Therefore, we set up groups according to the number of 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


items for which a difference in scores was observed: two or fewer and three or more for the free 

group, and one or more for the paid group. We then compared these groups using Mann-

Whitney U tests. The results showed that there was a significant difference in knowledge 

depending on the number of free self-study opportunities/modes (between two or fewer and three 

or more [p=.000]) and the number of paid self-study opportunities/modes (between one or no 

opportunities and two or more [p=.004]). 

Those with fewer than five years of clinical experience (n=4) scored higher on the 

knowledge test (mean 30.5 SD 5.74, median 31). However, those with fewer than five years of 

oncology nursing experience (n=44, mean 18 years of clinical experience) scored lower (mean 

23.7 SD 7.84, median 21). Although there was no significant difference in knowledge test scores 

for either years of clinical experience or of oncology nursing experience, correct responses were 

higher in the group with six or more years of clinical experience than in that with one to five 

years of experience. Scores were also higher for those with oncology nursing experience than for 

those without. 

Based on the results of the above analysis, the personal attributes and environmental 

characteristics that were related or correlated with the knowledge test scores were certifications 

held, academic society affiliation, free self-learning opportunities/media, irAE confirmation 

tools, and patient education tools. 

Regarding learning status, participants with previously predicted and unpredicted irAEs 

used multiple self-learning opportunities/modes. Furthermore, more than two-thirds of them 

indicated that they were already engaged in learning (more than six months and six months or 

under). 

3.4.2 Examination of Awareness of irAEs as Related to Knowledge Test Scores 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


The relationships between ICI and irAE knowledge test scores and awareness of irAEs are 

shown in Table 4. Free comments (n=23) on the awareness of irAEs are shown in Table 5; the 

relationships between ICI and irAE knowledge test scores could not be analyzed due to 

insufficient data. The results showed that independence was dismissed in knowledge test scores 

and awareness of irAEs, with "calling on oneself to identify irAEs," "patient education on the 

purpose of irAE prevention and coping behaviors is important," "improving knowledge of the 

antitumor effects and adverse events of the drugs administered to each patient is important," and 

"learning schedule for irAEs" were significantly different (p < .05). Hence, an association was 

observed. 

No association was found between "early detection of irAEs is the physician's role" and 

knowledge test scores. There was a significant difference between the "agree" and "neither agree 

nor disagree" groups (multiple comparison method). The "neither agree nor disagree" group had 

higher knowledge test scores. "It is the physician's role" and "it is not the physician's role" 

groups had lower scores than the "neither agree nor disagree" group. 

The "plan to learn" item of the awareness of irAE variable was the most relevant to 

knowledge test scores on ICIs and irAEs. 

3.4.3 Influencing Factors: Multiple Regression Analysis 

The multiple linear regression analysis results are shown in Table 6. We used a forced 

imputation method to examine the relationship between ICI and irAE knowledge test scores and 

the significant variables of attribute and irAE awareness. 

Therefore, the standardized coefficients (Î²) of each of the variables in the questionnaire 

showed that "plan to learn" and "certifications held" influenced the knowledge test scores, but 

the significant probability was p < .05 for "plan to learn." 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


4. Discussion 

In this section, we examine the relationship between the items based on the obtained 

results and discuss future strategies for nurses to acquire knowledge. 

4.1 Characteristics of the Target Population 

More than 70% of the participants were nurses in their 40s or older and working in 

medium-sized or larger facilities. This sample is slightly older than the general population of 

nurses in Japan, where just under 50% of hospital nurses are in their 40s or older. 28 More than 

70% of the nurses had experience of caring for more than 21 patients on ICI therapy, and nearly 

90% of the nurses worked in outpatient chemotherapy units, suggesting that this is a group 

involved in cancer drug therapy daily. 

4.2 Nurses` Knowledge Level 

As described earlier, the reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) for the knowledge test 

was 0.79. Therefore, the knowledge test used in this study remained reliable, and we believe it 

was appropriate for measuring nurses' knowledge on ICIs and irAEs in this aspect. Additionally, 

in terms of awareness of irAEs, nearly 35% of the participants who answered "already learning 

(more than six months)" to the question "plan to learn about irAEs" scored significantly higher 

(mean 29.07, SD 3.95, median 30) than who did not. This suggests that the test was an 

appropriate measure of the knowledge of those accessing learning opportunities. 

As per the result shown, in each of the irAE categories, only two categories had a higher-

than-average percentage of all questions answered correctly on the knowledge test: pulmonary 

dysfunction (41.7%) and hepatic dysfunction (27.1%). We believe that the pulmonary 

dysfunction knowledge score was the highest because of rising awareness among nurses about 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


reports of deaths because of the interstitial pulmonary dysfunction associated with ICI treatment 

and also because the mortality rate of drug-induced pulmonary dysfunction due to cancer drug 

therapy in Japan is higher than that in other countries. 30 Based on the above, the probability that 

nurses have been involved in the care of patients with cancer who develop drug-induced 

pulmonary dysfunction is high, so it can be inferred that nurses are aware of this problem. 

In contrast, the knowledge scores for dermatological dysfunction (47.2%), 

neurologic/musculoskeletal dysfunction (39.2%), endocrine dysfunction (46.3%), and cardiac 

dysfunction (48.3%) were below the average percentage of each question answered correctly. In 

these areas, a lack of penetration of disease-specific knowledge may be a factor. This is because 

the incidence of irAE itself is in the single digits, and a variety of diseases are included in this 

area. Although endocrine dysfunction also includes a variety of diseases, 56% of the participants 

correctly answered, "(c.) thyroid dysfunction is the least frequent endocrine dysfunction among 

irAEs (incorrect)." 4,6,7,20-22 It is assumed that the participants were aware of thyroid dysfunction, 

which is relatively frequent among irAEs; this led to the acquisition of knowledge. For cardiac 

dysfunction, the result indicates that the acquisition of knowledge about the general 

cardiovascular system is also an issue. 

The distinctive results showed that correct response rates for gastrointestinal and 

dermatological dysfunction, which are considered to occur more frequently among irAEs, 4,6,7,21-

23 were lower than those for neurologic/musculoskeletal dysfunction. The incidence of 

gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by ICIs is estimated to be 30%-40%, and fatalities, such as 

those resulting from intestinal perforation, have been reported. Unlike gastrointestinal disorders 

caused by cytotoxic anticancer drugs, the use of antidiarrheal agents may delay treatment for 

irAEs and cause serious complications. 4,6-8 However, the item-specific correct response rate was 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


low. 

In this knowledge test, questions related to general clinical symptoms and care were 

avoided as much as possible because the target audience was nurses who were already engaged 

in clinical practice. The test was composed of questions related to specialized knowledge of ICIs 

and irAEs as well as specific clinical symptoms and responses. Furthermore, the percentage of 

correct answers to irAE-specific questions, such as the frequency, timing, severity, and grade of 

irAEs, was low. Therefore, it can be considered that the participants lacked knowledge of ICIs 

and irAEs. 

According to the above data, we analyzed that nurses caring for cancer patients 

undergoing ICI treatment need to further improve their basic knowledge of ICIs and irAEs 

especially the frequency of incidence or are prone to become severe irAEs. Furthermore, the 

study found that nurses urgently need to acquire knowledge about low occurrence fatal irAEs. 

For preventing irAEs, it is significant to first know the immune-toxicity spectrum 13 , especially 

for early detection of irAEs, which is one of the most significant roles of nurses caring for 

patients undergoing ICI treatment. 

4.3 Influencing Factors of the Knowledge Test Scores and Attributes 

The ICI and irAE knowledge test scores for irAE management training participants were 

significantly higher than the scores of participants who had not participated in such training 

programs. Although participation in training programs is an effective means of acquiring 

knowledge, further intervention studies are needed because nurses who already possess the 

required knowledge may participate in training programs to acquire further knowledge. 

Nurses who engaged in self-learning had significantly higher knowledge test scores than 

those who did not. On the contrary, there was no significant difference in knowledge test scores 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


when only a single learning opportunity or mode was accessed, and the knowledge test scores 

were significantly higher when three or more free learning opportunities or modes were accessed 

or two or more paid learning opportunities or modes were accessed. This suggests that the use of 

multiple self-learning systems possibly in combination with a paid system will enable effective 

learning for knowledge acquisition. 

Furthermore, the knowledge test scores were significantly higher for participants who 

answered "yes" to the questions on experience with predictable or unpredictable irAEs than for 

those who answered "no" to predictable irAEs. In other words, those who indicated that they had 

experience with predictable or unpredictable irAEs had already acquired knowledge of irAEs and 

were likely to provide nursing care with awareness of irAEs. 

The results of this study showed a trend in terms of the extent of experience and 

institutional attributes of the target population; working in a specialized comprehensive cancer 

center did not significantly affect the level of expertise. Additionally, nurses working in general 

hospitals and university hospitals maintain their knowledge due to diverse associations. Although 

the sample size was small, the knowledge test scores were higher in those with fewer than five 

years of clinical experience (n=4; mean 30.5, SD 5.74, median 31). We can assume that after 

they graduated from a nursing educational institution, they were assigned to an outpatient 

chemotherapy center or outpatient department as nurses with recently updated knowledge. 

There was no significant difference in knowledge test scores according to the number of 

years of clinical experience or the number of years of oncology nursing experience. However, 

the percentage of correct answers increased with the number of years of clinical experience. 

There was also no significant difference in knowledge test scores according to the number of 

years of experience working in comprehensive cancer centers or chemotherapy centers. 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


Furthermore, those with six to ten years of experience working in comprehensive cancer centers 

had the lowest scores compared to the overall group without work experience in comprehensive 

cancers. Additionally, the scores of those with fewer than five years of oncology nursing 

experience (n=44; mean 18 years of clinical experience) were the lowest (mean 23.7, SD 7.84, 

median 21). These results suggest that nurses' knowledge acquisition is highly influenced by the 

environment in which they are placed, for instance the availability of ICI-specific questionnaires 

and patient education tools. 

Nurses using ICI-specific questionnaires, irAE confirmation tool, and patient education 

tool had significantly higher knowledge test scores than those who did not. As nurses use these 

tools to make direct explanations to patients, it is highly likely that nurses learn about irAEs 

ahead of time, before explaining them to patients, or that they learn about them through such 

patient explanations. This will likely be an opportunity to acquire knowledge not only for nurses 

with limited experience, as mentioned earlier, but also for nurses involved in such situations. 

4.4 Influencing Factors of Knowledge and Awareness of irAEs 

Participants who answered "agree (it is important)" to the questions on the importance of 

talking to patients, educating patients, and improving their own knowledge had significantly 

higher knowledge test scores. It can be assumed that a high knowledge test score is a result of 

learning, which further results in confidence in nursing. It can also be assumed that nurses select 

and implement appropriate nursing care based on specific information, theories, and methods; 

that is, the patient is approached and the irAE is confirmed. 29 

There was a significant difference in the response to the question on whether early 

detection of irAEs is the physician's responsibility when an in-house ICI-related 

multidisciplinary team exists. Moreover, the presence of qualified personnel in the hospital, or in 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


a nurse's own department, was significantly related to nurses talking to patients themselves; 

however, no significant relationship was found with "plan to learn." 

4.5 Future Suggestions for Knowledge Acquisition 

Regarding the question on "plan to learn" in the questions on awareness of irAEs, the 

transtheoretical model (TTM) 32 was used. The finding indicates that further research is needed to 

determine the kind of approach that should be adopted in the future to educate the 30% who were 

in the contemplation and precontemplation stages. In this study, nearly 95% of the nurses 

indicated that they used free learning opportunities/modes for self-improvement, including 

seminars, lectures, training sessions, conference-produced materials, and e-learning. The TTM 

considers the use of these modes to be part of the preparation stage. 

Additionally, computerized interactive interventions may lead to significant results in 

terms of behavior changes. 27 Digital tools such as apps and social networking sites, which were 

among the answer choices for learning opportunities/modes currently used, were not mentioned 

in the survey results. However, the participants freely stated that they would learn if online 

learning materials and tools were available or if they had the time and schedule flexibility to 

participate. Thus, it is possible that on-demand digital tools that are interactive and can be 

completed at any pace, according to one's own convenience, would be useful. 

4.6 Limitations and Future Challenges 

As mentioned earlier, the content of the irAE knowledge test was extracted from the 

Cancer Immunotherapy Guidelines 4 and relevant literature. 6-8,20-22,31,32 The test was then 

confirmed by an expert panel. However, further validation is needed to evaluate the reliability of 

the test as a knowledge test on ICIs and irAEs. Additionally, further research is needed to 

evaluate the correct response rate of this test, including validation and different target groups. 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


In this survey, about 90% of the participants were nurses who care for patients 

undergoing anticancer drug therapy in outpatient chemotherapy units or outpatient infusion 

centers. In the future, it will be necessary to devise recruitment methods so that more nurses who 

provide cancer nursing care at general outpatient clinics or best supportive care units can be 

included. The reason is that most patients receiving ICI treatment have intervals between 

administration (two to six weeks 20,21 ); irAEs may occur late after the completion of 

treatment, 4,9,20-22 and the occurrence of irAEs may require permanent treatment for irAEs. 

Additionally, ICIs may be combined with other cancer drugs or radiation therapy based on new 

regimen approvals. The management of irAEs resulting from ICIs requires educating patients 

prior to treatment and providing ongoing support through multiple methods tailored to each 

patient. 13,31 In parallel, nurses need to know what to ask and how to respond to patients, and they 

must have experience and knowledge of the treatment and underlying disease so that they can 

distinguish complications. 33 Nurses play a role not only in preventing physical deterioration 

through early detection of irAEs but also in supporting patients to continue the necessary or 

desired treatment over the mid-to-long-term period. Considering the above, it is necessary to 

further verify the results of this study by conducting an additional survey that fully addresses the 

context of these participants. 

5. Conclusion 

This study revealed that there is room for nurses to acquire more knowledge about ICIs 

and irAEs, as ICI pharmacotherapy occupies an important position in cancer treatment. 

Based on the suggestions from the study findings and in light of the above, specific 

consideration should be given to computerized interactive tools that are appropriate to the 

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 


nurses' stage of knowledge acquisition, to building an ICI-related multidisciplinary team or a 

potential substitute for such a team at hospitals, and to increasing nurses' awareness of their role 

in confronting patients by providing specific information on how appropriate feedback and 

change can lead to positive outcomes for patients. A challenge for the future is to build multiple 

effective knowledge acquisition opportunities through patient education tools, questionnaires, 

and other direct patient media and linking them to behavior change. Based on the present results, 

the possibility of clinical application to the acquisition of knowledge in other fields and other 

treatment methods should also be considered.
