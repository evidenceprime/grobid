			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one of the<lb/> most common types of digestive NETs. The inci-<lb/>dence of detected rectal NETs has increased in the<lb/> past few decades due to the increased number of<lb/> colonoscopies. <ref type="biblio">1-5</ref> As rectal NETs &lt;10 mm in size carry<lb/> a low risk of lymph node metastasis, <ref type="biblio">6-9</ref> current guide-<lb/>lines recommend local excision including endoscopic<lb/> resection (ER) for these tumors. <ref type="biblio">10<lb/></ref> There are many established ER methods, including<lb/> conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (c-EMR), <ref type="biblio">11<lb/></ref> endoscopic submucosal resection with band ligation<lb/> (ESMR-L), <ref type="biblio">12</ref> endoscopic submucosal resection with cap<lb/> aspiration (ESMR-C), <ref type="biblio">13</ref> EMR after circumferential inci-<lb/>sion (precutting EMR), <ref type="biblio">14</ref> and endoscopic submucosal<lb/> dissection (ESD). <ref type="biblio">15</ref> Of these, especially ESMR-L and<lb/> ESD are commonly performed procedures for rectal<lb/> NET resection in daily clinical practice. Several reports<lb/> address the efficacy of modified EMR (ESMR-L, ESMR-<lb/>C, and precutting EMR) and ESD. <ref type="biblio">16-19</ref> However, most<lb/> of these reports are from a single high-volume center,<lb/> and there are a few from multiple facilities. Furthermore,<lb/> there have been no reports focused on the impact of<lb/> the endoscopist&apos;s experience on treatment outcomes for<lb/> each of these ER methods. Thus, additional evidence is<lb/> required to establish an optimal strategy for ER in rectal<lb/> NETs. Therefore, we surveyed the results of ER treat-<lb/>ments for small rectal NETs in a multi-center database,<lb/> focusing on a comparison between ESMR-L and ESD.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS</head><lb/> 
			
			<head>Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of<lb/> patients who underwent ESMR-L or ESD from 2010 to<lb/> 2019 for rectal NETs &lt;10 mm in size. This study was<lb/> conducted at 11 Japanese facilities, including univer-<lb/>sity hospitals, general hospitals, and practicing clinics.<lb/> Relevant data of the patients and lesions collected<lb/> from the clinical records were analyzed. The evalu-<lb/>ation items were as follows: clinical background of<lb/> the patient, the ER method, the procedure time, per-<lb/>forations and postoperative bleeding as complications,<lb/> the R0 resection rate, and the hospitalization period.<lb/> Patients who were treated other than by ESMR-L or<lb/> ESD, such as by c-EMR, ESMR-C, or precutting EMR,<lb/> were excluded. Patients with multiple lesions were also<lb/> excluded.<lb/></p>

			<p>Written informed consent was obtained from all<lb/> patients prior to treatment. This study was approved<lb/> by the Ethical Committee of Kumamoto University<lb/> Hospital (approval number 2015) and performed in<lb/> accordance with the ethical principles associated with<lb/> the Declaration of Helsinki.<lb/></p>

			<head>Endoscopic procedures<lb/></head>

			<p>In accordance with the guidelines, rectal NETs less<lb/> than 10 mm without obvious muscular invasion or<lb/> metastasis were indicated for ER. Most cases were<lb/> treated after the histological diagnosis of NET by endo-<lb/>scopic biopsies. Prior to the procedure, endoscopic<lb/> ultrasonography to rule out muscle layer invasion and<lb/> computed tomography to rule out metastases were<lb/> usually performed.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the ESMR-L procedure, the lesion is aspirated<lb/> and ligated using a ligation device (Sumitomo Bakelite<lb/> Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) after submucosal injection, and<lb/> resected with a snare placed below the ligation band.<lb/> Routinely, saline was used for submucosal injection, and<lb/> endoscopic closure of mucosal defects was with clips<lb/> after resection.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the ESD procedure, incision and deeper cutting cre-<lb/>ate a mucosal flap after submucosal injection; thereafter,<lb/> a circumferential incision with submucosal dissection is<lb/> performed until the tumor can be completely removed.<lb/> A Dual knife (KD-650Q; Olympus) or a Flush knife<lb/> (DK2618JB; Fujifilm) was mainly used for the ESD pro-<lb/>cedure. Coagulation was occasionally performed with<lb/> hemostatic forceps for the exposed vessels after resec-<lb/>tion. Routinely, 0.4% hyaluronic acid (MucoUP; Boston<lb/> Scientific Japan Co.) was used, and endoscopic closure<lb/> for mucosal defects was not conducted after resection.<lb/></p>

			<p>All of the procedures were carried out by a total of 60<lb/> different endoscopists. The choice of ER method was<lb/> made by each endoscopist.<lb/></p>

			<head>Histological evaluation<lb/></head>

			<p>Hematoxylin-Eosin and immunohistochemical staining<lb/> (chromogranin A, synaptophysin) was performed on<lb/> formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples after ER.<lb/> Tumor size, invasion depth, lymphatic and vascular<lb/> involvement, and tumor involvement in the lateral and<lb/> vertical margins, were histologically assessed. The<lb/> lympho-vascular invasion was usually evaluated by<lb/> immunostaining (CD34, Victoria blue, and D2-40). Ki-<lb/>67 was used to evaluate cell proliferation and classify<lb/> the grade of the tumor. Grade 1 was defined as hav-<lb/>ing a mitotic count &lt;2 per 10 high-power fields and/or<lb/> Ki67 ≤2%. The pathological diagnosis was based on the<lb/> 2010 World Health Organization classification of tumors<lb/> of the digestive system.<lb/></p>

			<head>Definition<lb/></head>

			<p>The procedure time was defined as the time from inser-<lb/>tion to the removal of the endoscope. Perforation was<lb/> defined as a visible hole in the rectum wall recog-<lb/>nized during the procedure, or free air detected by<lb/> abdominal computed tomography after the procedure.<lb/> Postoperative bleeding was defined as the presence<lb/> of fresh bloody stool, which required urgent endoscopy<lb/> for hemostasis. R0 resection was defined as en bloc<lb/> resection with tumor-free lateral and vertical margins.<lb/> &quot;Experienced&quot; endoscopists were defined as having<lb/> performed more than 3000 colonoscopies and 500<lb/> colonic c-EMR and/or 30 colonic ESD at each point of<lb/> treatment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>Clinical outcomes were analyzed using the Mann-<lb/>Whitney U test, Student&apos;s t-test, Fisher&apos;s exact test, or<lb/> chi-squared test, as appropriate. Multivariate logistic and<lb/> linear regression models were also employed based<lb/> on propensity scores to adjust for candidate confound-<lb/>ing factors. To generate the propensity score, logistic<lb/> regression was performed using the ER method as the<lb/> outcome, and the five variables were age, sex, tumor<lb/> location, tumor size, and endoscopists&apos; experience. Lin-<lb/>ear regression models using patients from each medical<lb/> facility as a cluster were employed to evaluate asso-<lb/>ciations between treatment and outcome. In addition,<lb/> the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)<lb/> method based on propensity scoring was used to esti-<lb/>mate the average treatment effect of ESMR-L compared<lb/> to ESD. In these models, outcome variables such as<lb/> ESD procedure time or dissection speed were log-<lb/>transformed because of their skewed distribution. Thus,<lb/> in the multivariate linear regression models, the ESMR-L<lb/> and ESD procedure times were compared by estimating<lb/> the exponentials of regression coefficients. Probability<lb/> values for statistical tests were two-tailed and p &lt; 0.05<lb/> was considered significant. Statistical analysis was per-<lb/>formed with R version 3.3.3 (R Foundation, Vienna,<lb/> Austria), and STATA15.1 (StataCorp, Lakeway Drive,<lb/> Texas).<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/></head>

			<p>From January 2010 to December 2019, a total of 218<lb/> patients who underwent ER for rectal NETs &lt;10 mm<lb/> enrolled from 11 institutions for this study. Of these, we<lb/> excluded 10 patients who underwent ER by a method<lb/> other than ESMR-L or ESD (these were four c-EMR, five<lb/> ESMR-C, and one precutting EMR). We also excluded<lb/> three patients who had multiple NET lesions resected<lb/> in a single procedure. Hence, we finally analyzed 205<lb/> patients, 89 of whom were treated by ESMR-L, and 116<lb/> by ESD. The study flowchart is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The characteristics of the patients and their lesions<lb/> are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The lesions were mainly located<lb/> in the lower rectum (n = 177, 86%), and the median<lb/> tumor size was 5 mm. The mean age of the patients who<lb/> underwent ESD was higher than that of ESMR-L (53±13<lb/> years vs. 58 ± 13 years, p = 0.02), and the median tumor<lb/> size in the former was larger (4 mm vs. 5 mm, p &lt; 0.01).<lb/> The proportion of experienced endoscopists was signif-<lb/>icantly greater than for ESD compared to ESMR-L (80%<lb/> vs. 55%, p = 0.04).<lb/></p>

			<p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> depicts the univariate analysis of treatment<lb/> outcomes. All lesions were resected en bloc either by<lb/> ESMR-L or ESD, with no significant difference in the R0<lb/> resection rate (90% vs. 92%, p = 0.73). The procedure<lb/> time was significantly shorter for ESMR-L than for ESD<lb/> patients (17 min vs. 52 min, p &lt; 0.01), and the hospi-<lb/>talization period was also shorter for ESMR-L patients<lb/> (3 days vs. 5 days, p&lt; 0.01). No instance of perforation<lb/> was found in any of the patients, and the rate of post-<lb/>operative bleeding was not significantly different (7% vs.<lb/> 2%, p = 0.14). All cases of postoperative bleeding were<lb/></p>

			<p>successfully managed with endoscopic hemostasis, and<lb/> no blood transfusion or surgery was required. We also<lb/> showed the clinical outcomes of each 11 institutions in<lb/> Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>Multivariate regression analysis was then applied to<lb/> compare ESMR-L with ESD, confirming that the proce-<lb/>dure time was significantly shorter for the former (odds<lb/> ratio = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26-0.40, p<lb/> &lt; 0.001) and that the R0 resection rate was not signif-<lb/>icantly different (odds ratio = 0.62, 95% CI 0.08-4.58,<lb/> p = 0.641; Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The hospitalization period was also<lb/> confirmed to be significantly shorter after ESMR-L (odds<lb/> ratio = 0.45, 95% CI 0.24-0.86, p = 0.021; Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/> In the IPTW analysis, the estimated mean procedure<lb/> time when using the ESMR-L method was also signif-<lb/>icantly shorter than for ESD (odds ratio = 0.33, 95%<lb/> CI 0.27-0.41, p &lt; 0.001), and again, the R0 resection<lb/> rate was not significantly different (odds ratio = 0.98,<lb/> 95% CI 0.89-1.07, p = 0.614; Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The hospital-<lb/>ization period was also significantly shorter for patients<lb/> after ESMR-L (odds ratio = 0.46, 95% CI 0.39-0.53, p &lt;<lb/> 0.001; Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the subgroup analysis, we evaluated the impact<lb/> of the endoscopist&apos;s experience on the technical out-<lb/>comes for each ER method. For the ESMR-L, there was<lb/> no difference in procedure time between experienced<lb/> and less-experienced endoscopists (17 min vs. 17 min,<lb/> p = 0.269; Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). On the other hand, for ESD, the<lb/> median procedure time was longer in cases treated by<lb/> less-experienced endoscopists (49 min vs. 70 min, p =<lb/> 0.017;Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).There was no significant difference in the<lb/> R0 resection rate whether performed by experienced or<lb/> less-experienced endoscopist both in ESMR-L (86.4%<lb/> vs. 96.7%, p = 0.263; Table <ref type="table">4</ref>) and ESD procedure<lb/> (92.5% vs. 91.3%, p &gt; 0.99; Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). The hospitalization<lb/> period was longer in both the ESMR-L (2 days vs. 3 days,<lb/> p &lt; 0.023; Table <ref type="table">4</ref>) and ESD groups (5 days vs. 8 days,<lb/> p &lt; 0.001; Table <ref type="table">4</ref>) when treated by less-experienced<lb/> endoscopists.<lb/></p>

			<p>We also examined the impact of endoscopist experi-<lb/>ence level on treatment outcomes using linear or logistic<lb/> regression models adjusted by propensity score. The<lb/> procedure time of ESD was significantly prolonged by<lb/> less-experienced endoscopists (odds ratio = 1.42, 95%<lb/> CI 1.12-1.80, p = 0.009; Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>), but that of ESMR-L<lb/> was not affected (odds ratio = 1.14, 95% CI 0.92-1.40,<lb/> p = 0.205; Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). ESMR-L performed by less-<lb/>experienced endoscopists did not result in lower R0<lb/> resection rates (odds ratio = 3.94, 95% CI 0.32-47.96,<lb/> p = 0.282; Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>), and that was also confirmed by the<lb/> ESD procedure (odds ratio = 0.75, 95% CI 0.16-3.53,<lb/> p = 0.716; Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In this study, 27 patients (13%) had a lympho-vascular<lb/> invasion. Of which, 13 underwent additional surgery, and<lb/> one of them was found to have lymph node metastasis.<lb/> No apparent lymph node recurrence was observed in<lb/> patients who did not undergo additional surgery. There<lb/> were no confirmed cases of local recurrence during<lb/> the follow-up period, with a median 35-month (interquar-<lb/>tile range 25%-75%, 14-61) follow-up observation. In<lb/> contrast, a distant metastatic recurrence was confirmed<lb/> in one case in the ESD group. The lesion was NET<lb/> grade 2 of WHO classification, 7 mm in size without<lb/> lympho-vascular invasion, and the horizontal and ver-<lb/>tical margins were free. However, the patient did not<lb/> accept the additional surgery. After more than 9 years<lb/> passed since the ESD procedure, multiple liver masses<lb/> were pointed out, and the biopsy revealed a recurrence<lb/> of NET.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>In this retrospective study for rectal NETs &lt;10 mm<lb/> in size, the patients who underwent ESMR-L required<lb/> a significantly shorter procedure and shorter hospi-<lb/>talization period than those who underwent ESD, but<lb/> there was no difference in the R0 resection rate. These<lb/> results were confirmed after adjusting for confound-<lb/>ing factors using both multivariate analysis and the<lb/> IPTW method. Interestingly, the level of endoscopists&apos;<lb/> experience significantly affected the procedure time<lb/> for ESD more than for ESMR-L, and ESMR-L per-<lb/>formed by less-experienced endoscopists did not result<lb/> in lower R0 resection rates. Both resection meth-<lb/>ods resulted in a longer hospitalization period when<lb/> treated by less-experienced endoscopists. There was<lb/> no significant difference in the complication rates by<lb/> endoscopist&apos;s experience. This might be because the<lb/> patients treated by less-experienced endoscopists had<lb/> a longer hospital stay after treatment and were followed<lb/> more carefully.<lb/></p>

			<p>In our study, the R0 resection rate was not significantly<lb/> different between ESMR-L and ESD (90% vs. 92%, p<lb/> = 0.73), similar to what has been previously reported<lb/> (81%-100%, 54%-100%, respectively). <ref type="biblio">12-25</ref> However,<lb/> our simulation using the data of this study revealed<lb/> that the statistical power to verify the non-inferiority of<lb/> ESMR-L compared to ESD was low (&lt;0.1), suggesting<lb/> the necessity of further investigations with a large sam-<lb/>ple size. There have been two meta-analyses comparing<lb/> ESD and modified EMR, which include ESMR-L and<lb/> EMR-C, as ER methods for rectal NETs. <ref type="biblio">26,27</ref> The latest<lb/> meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the<lb/> R0 resection rate between ESMR-L and ESD, consistent<lb/> with our results. All of these previous reports found that<lb/> the procedure time of ESMR-L was significantly shorter<lb/> than ESD, as we also found. Most of these reports were<lb/> from a single high-volume center, and the number of<lb/> cases in each report was small. Hence, in contrast, our<lb/> study had a relatively large number of cases from multi-<lb/>ple institutions, including the university hospital, general<lb/> hospitals, and practicing clinics. The guidelines did not<lb/> specify which resection method is recommended. <ref type="biblio">10,28<lb/></ref> Additional evidence is still needed.<lb/></p>

			<p>In most cases for which R0 resection was not<lb/> achieved, the vertical margins were either unclear or<lb/> positive. Free vertical margins are the most important<lb/> for achieving the complete resection of small rectal<lb/> NETS. For the ESD procedure, the submucosal dis-<lb/>section should be performed just above the muscular<lb/> layer in order to avoid the burning effect on the tumor.<lb/> However,this procedure benefits from more experienced<lb/> endoscopic skills and entails a longer procedure time. In<lb/> contrast, ESMR-L is a relatively simple and rapid proce-<lb/>dure not requiring so much endoscopic experience and<lb/> skill. For this reason, the endoscopist&apos;s experience sig-<lb/>nificantly affected the procedure time of ESD more than<lb/> ESMR-L. ESMR-L also has an economic advantage<lb/> because it does not require the use of various differ-<lb/>ent endoscopic knives, hemostat forceps, and expensive<lb/> liquids for submucosal injection. In addition, a shorter<lb/> hospitalization period is favorable in terms of medical<lb/> costs.<lb/></p>

			<p>All of the horizontal margins were negative in the ESD<lb/> group, whereas three cases of horizontal margins were<lb/> unclear in the ESMR-L group.This may be due to the fact<lb/> that specimens after ESMR-L were often not stretched<lb/> and fixed on the board before being fixed in formalin.<lb/> Although no additional surgical resection was performed<lb/> in these three cases with unclear horizontal margins,<lb/> none of them had obvious local recurrence. Of the three<lb/> patients with unclear horizontal margins, two also had<lb/> unclear vertical margins. Only one patient had unclear<lb/> horizontal margins with free vertical margins. This lesion<lb/> was located near the scar of c-EMR that had been per-<lb/>formed previously. ESD would be better indicated for<lb/> such a lesion near the scar because of its flexibility in<lb/> the resection area. ESD would also be more suitable<lb/> for large rectal NET lesions, although it is not usually<lb/> indicated for ER.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is no definitive consensus on the definition<lb/> of &quot;experienced&quot; endoscopists. In the systematic liter-<lb/>ature review of learning curves for colorectal polyp<lb/> resection techniques, <ref type="biblio">29</ref> higher en bloc and complete<lb/> resection rates were achieved in 50-300 cases with the<lb/> colonic c-EMR procedure and 20-40 cases with<lb/> the ESD procedure. Furthermore, it was reported that<lb/> the procedural speed was increased after 30 cases<lb/> in the ESD procedure. Because only a few endoscopists<lb/> had extensive experience with ESMR-L procedures and<lb/> colorectal ESD procedures in our study, we also defined<lb/> &quot;experienced&quot; endoscopists with extensive colonoscopy<lb/> and colonic c-EMR experiences.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our study has some limitations. First, this is a ret-<lb/>rospective analysis of procedures. The choice of ER<lb/> methods was dependent on the institution and the oper-<lb/>ator, and there were no clear criteria. Although we have<lb/> adjusted for candidate confounding factors, it might be<lb/> a major selection bias. Second, the timing of treatment<lb/> might affect the technical results since the duration of<lb/> our study period was 10 years. Third, because this study<lb/> focused on treatment outcomes, the long-term outcome<lb/> data were insufficient to draw any conclusions in later<lb/> clinical courses. Forth, the procedure time of our study<lb/> seemed to be longer than in the previous reports.It might<lb/> be due to the definition of procedure time as the time<lb/> from insertion to the removal of the endoscope. Despite<lb/> these limitations,the strength of our study is that it exam-<lb/>ined the impact of endoscopists´experience on each<lb/> ER method for rectal NETs with a relatively large num-<lb/>ber of cases, and analyzed the treatment outcome of<lb/> many endoscopists a further strength.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, compared with ESD, ESMR-L had<lb/> a shorter procedure time and shorter hospitalization<lb/> period despite the similar R0 resection rate and com-<lb/>plication rate. The procedure time of ESD was affected<lb/> by the endoscopists&apos;experience but that of ESMR-L was<lb/> not. Therefore, ESMR-L is considered to be a more effi-<lb/>cient treatment method than ESD for small rectal NETs,<lb/> especially for less-experienced endoscopists.<lb/></p>
