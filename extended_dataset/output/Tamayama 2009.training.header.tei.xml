	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Allergic rhinitis is not a fatal disease, but its symptoms deteriorate the quality of life. High mor-<lb/>bidity raises a concern about its impact on health care resources. Utility weights, which are required for cost-<lb/>utility analysis by the level of severity, have not been established to date. This study aims to derive the weights<lb/> based on a community survey with a time trade-off technique.<lb/> Methods: Self-administered monthly time trade-off questionnaires were administered to representative sam-<lb/>ples in the community. Four levels of severity were defined by clinical stratification proposed in the &quot;Practical<lb/> Guideline for the Management of Allergic Rhinitis in Japan&quot;.<lb/> Results: 146 responses (response rate: 51.0%) were collected. Utility weights by the four levels of severity<lb/> were found to be 0.96, 0.94, 0.89 and 0.83, from mild to severest symptoms, respectively. These values were<lb/> found to be statistically independent from the respondent&apos;s characteristics such as sex, age, existence of cur-<lb/>rent nasal symptoms or history of allergic rhinitis.<lb/> Conclusions: The authors consider that the elicited utility weights are reliable. The results of this study could<lb/> facilitate economic evaluations regarding allergic rhinitis in various contexts, contributing to better management<lb/> of the disease.<lb/></div>
