			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Allergic rhinitis (AR), with or without conjunc-<lb/>tivitis, is one of the most common<lb/> Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated atopic dis-<lb/>eases <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. It is an allergic reaction caused by IgE-<lb/>mediated inflammation of the nasal mucosa<lb/> which is triggered by a previous sensitization<lb/> against an allergen. Characteristic symptoms of<lb/> AR include sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinor-<lb/>rhoea, and nasal pruritus.<lb/></p>

			<p>AR is a high-prevalence disease in many<lb/> developed countries <ref type="biblio">[2-4]</ref>. In the European<lb/> general population, the prevalence of allergic<lb/> rhinitis was found to be around 25% <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>AR is a disease with &apos;&apos;uncontrolled symp-<lb/>toms, impaired quality of life, and unpleasant<lb/> comorbidities&apos;&apos; <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>, having a significant impact<lb/> on patients&apos; well-being <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. Besides AR<lb/> symptoms, affected patients can suffer from<lb/> impaired concentration, sleeping disorders,<lb/> irritability, decreased performance at school or<lb/> work, avoidance of outdoor activities, and<lb/> higher risk for infections. Moreover, AR is<lb/> associated with numerous comorbidities, and it<lb/> is a strong risk factor for the development of<lb/> allergic asthma: 15-38% of patients with AR<lb/> have asthma comorbidity <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The management of AR is aimed at control-<lb/>ling symptoms and reducing inflammation. It<lb/> includes three key pillars: allergen avoidance,<lb/> targeted pharmacological treatment, and aller-<lb/>gen immunotherapy (AIT). Of these, AIT is the<lb/> only mechanistic-based treatment able to alter<lb/> the natural course of the disease, with long-<lb/>term effects after discontinuation of treatment<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. In addition to improving AR severity, AIT<lb/> can also successfully prevent the development<lb/> of associated diseases, such as allergic bronchial<lb/> asthma <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The clinical efficacy of AIT in the treatment<lb/> of AR and/or asthma has been shown for several<lb/> standardized AIT products in randomized con-<lb/>trolled clinical trials <ref type="biblio">[8, 10]</ref>. However, in addi-<lb/>tion to clinical efficacy, it is pivotal to<lb/> determine the benefit of a treatment in real-life<lb/> clinical practice from the patients&apos; perspective,<lb/> i.e. to determine whether clinical benefit<lb/> translates into patient benefit. Perceived benefit<lb/> is crucial, not only as a pivotal endpoint in itself<lb/> but also because it can be expected to increase<lb/> treatment satisfaction and adherence to treat-<lb/>ment, and can subsequently help to improve<lb/> treatment efficacy. Benefit will depend on the<lb/> patients&apos; treatment goals and expectations,<lb/> which in turn are determined by their individ-<lb/>ual life style, circumstances, and preferences.<lb/> Patients&apos; expectations often go beyond mea-<lb/>surable symptom reductions <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. Besides a<lb/> relief of symptoms, patients generally expect a<lb/> reduction of morbidity, improvement in quality<lb/> of life, and a reduction of treatment burden<lb/> (defined as the workload of healthcare for the<lb/> patients and its impact on patient functioning<lb/> and well-being <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>). The benefit that a treat-<lb/>ment has in patients&apos; lives can only be evalu-<lb/>ated by the patients themselves, not by the<lb/> treating clinicians.<lb/></p>

			<p>Focussing on birch pollen allergy, a major<lb/> source of AR in Europe <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>, the aim of this real-<lb/>life medical practice study was to determine the<lb/> patient-relevant benefit of a birch pollen sub-<lb/>lingual immunotherapy (SLIT) treatment from<lb/> the AR patients&apos; perspective by using the Patient<lb/> Benefit Index Allergic Rhinitis (PBI-AR). The<lb/> efficacy of this birch pollen SLIT treatment had<lb/> been shown previously in two double-blind,<lb/> placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[14, 15]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The PBI-AR is a standardized and validated<lb/> instrument which has been shown to be corre-<lb/>lated with treatment satisfaction, patient<lb/> health-related quality of life, and treatment<lb/> burden, with more satisfied and less burdened<lb/> patients showing higher patient benefit <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The PBI-AR global benefit score was the pri-<lb/>mary outcome of this study. In further analyses,<lb/> we aimed to determine the distribution of<lb/> treatment goals, goal achievement, and PBI-AR<lb/> subscale scores, and to determine associations<lb/> of the PBI-AR with a number of patient char-<lb/>acteristics as well as global benefit ratings by<lb/> patients and physicians.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS</head><lb/> 
			<head>Study Design<lb/></head>

			<p>This was a 1-year, open, prospective, multicen-<lb/>ter, non-interventional study in patients treated<lb/> with birch pollen SLIT. The study protocol was<lb/> approved by the Freiburg Ethics Commission<lb/> International. Patients gave written informed<lb/> consent and the study conformed with the<lb/> Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in 2013,<lb/> concerning human rights.<lb/></p>

			<head>Procedures<lb/></head>

			<p>Patients were recruited between autumn 2012<lb/> and the first quarter of 2013 by 75 allergologi-<lb/>cally experienced specialists (mainly ear, nose,<lb/> and throat physicians, dermatologists, and<lb/> pulmonologists) working in secondary care<lb/> across Germany. Each investigator was asked to<lb/> recruit three or more consecutive patients for<lb/> whom the decision to initiate birch pollen SLIT<lb/> had already been taken. The nationwide<lb/> recruitment of investigators and consecutive<lb/> enrolment of eligible patients should ensure<lb/> that a representative sample from the patient<lb/> population was selected. Patients were included<lb/> in the study after the decision for birch pollen<lb/> SLIT had already been made.<lb/></p>

			<p>Eligible for this study were male or female<lb/> patients (C 18 years) presenting with birch pol-<lb/>len-induced allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis,<lb/> rhinoconjunctivitis, and/or mild asthma con-<lb/>firmed by a positive skin prick test and/or a<lb/> positive serum titre of specific IgE, and who<lb/> gave their written informed consent. Exclusion<lb/> criteria were: hypersensitivity to any of the<lb/> excipients of the sublingual solution; immune<lb/> deficiency or autoimmune diseases; malignant<lb/> diseases; uncontrolled or severe asthma [forced<lb/> expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) \ 70% of pre-<lb/>dicted value]; or inflammatory conditions in<lb/> the oral cavity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two visits were planned during the observa-<lb/>tion phase: a study initiation visit at the<lb/> beginning of treatment and a study end visit<lb/> after the first birch pollen season with SLIT<lb/> (birch pollen season 2013). During each visit,<lb/> investigators completed an electronic case<lb/> report form (eCRF) for each patient, while<lb/> patients filled in a paper-based questionnaire.<lb/> At the first visit, investigators documented<lb/> baseline data, such as demographic data, medi-<lb/>cal history (clinical manifestations of the<lb/> allergy. i.e. rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma,<lb/> atopic dermatitis; concomitant allergies), con-<lb/>comitant diseases and medication, impairment<lb/> due to allergic symptoms in the tree pollen<lb/> season before birch pollen SLIT treatment start<lb/> [Allergic Rhinitis Impact on Asthma (ARIA)<lb/> classification of allergic rhinitis symptoms,<lb/> severity of symptoms], and start date of SLIT.<lb/> Patients assessed their patient needs, i.e. their<lb/> treatment-related expectations. At the second<lb/> visit, documentation included data on treat-<lb/>ment, impairment due to allergic symptoms<lb/> during the first tree pollen season on SLIT<lb/> treatment, and treatment-related patient bene-<lb/>fit. Physicians&apos; and patients&apos; judgements on<lb/> improvement in well-being were also assessed at<lb/> the second visit.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this article, we report the main outcomes<lb/> of the study, i.e. patient needs/expectations and<lb/> benefits as measured with the Patient Benefit<lb/> Index (PBI).<lb/></p>

			<head>Study Treatment<lb/></head>

			<p>Patients were treated with Staloral Ã’ Birch 300<lb/> IR/ml (Stallergenes, Antony, France), a sublin-<lb/>gual solution of standardized birch pollen<lb/> allergen extract at a concentration of 10 IR/ml<lb/> (during the titration phase) and 300 IR/ml<lb/> (during both the titration and maintenance<lb/> phases). IR (= index of reactivity) is an in-house<lb/> unit to express biological activity. Treatment<lb/> was initiated with an 11-day titration phase<lb/> with increasing doses of the 10 IR/ml (1, 2, 4, 6,<lb/> 8, and 10 puffs) and the 300 IR/ml concentra-<lb/>tion (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 puffs), followed by a<lb/> maintenance phase. According to the investi-<lb/>gators&apos; prescriptions, patients took 4 or 8 puffs<lb/> of the 300 IR/ml concentration once daily dur-<lb/>ing the maintenance phase, following either a<lb/> perennial or a pre-/co-seasonal treatment<lb/> schedule. The extract had to be placed directly<lb/> under the tongue and kept there for 2 min<lb/> before being swallowed.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Patient Benefit Index<lb/></head>

			<p>The PBI is a standardized and validated instru-<lb/>ment that measures patient-reported treatment<lb/> needs and benefits; there are both a standard<lb/> version for dermatological indications <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref> and<lb/> an indication-specific version. Each PBI version<lb/> consists of 2 questionnaires: The Patient Needs<lb/> Questionnaire (PNQ) is filled in before treat-<lb/>ment. It consists of standardized items on pre-<lb/>defined treatment goals that refer to symptom<lb/> reduction (e.g. &apos;&apos;no longer have a runny or<lb/> stuffed up nose&apos;&apos;; &apos;&apos;not have sneezing impulses<lb/> anymore&apos;&apos;), but also to improvement of quality<lb/> of life (e.g. &apos;&apos;be able to engage in normal leisure<lb/> activities&apos;&apos;) and low burden of the treatment<lb/> itself (e.g. &apos;&apos;have fewer side effects&apos;&apos;). Patients<lb/> rate the importance of each goal on a Likert<lb/> scale ranging from 0 = &apos;&apos;not at all [important]&apos;&apos;<lb/> to 4 = &apos;&apos;very [important]&apos;&apos;. The Patient Benefit<lb/> Questionnaire (PBQ) is filled in during or after<lb/> therapy. It consists of the same items as the<lb/> PNQ, but the instructions differ. Here, the<lb/> patients rate the extent to which the treatment<lb/> needs have been achieved by therapy using a<lb/> Likert scale ranging from 0 = &apos;&apos;not at all&apos;&apos; to<lb/> 4 = &apos;&apos;very&apos;&apos;. As an alternative, the patient can<lb/> tick &apos;&apos;does not apply to me&apos;&apos; in the PNQ and &apos;&apos;did<lb/> not apply to me&apos;&apos; in the PBQ; in that case, the<lb/> item is considered irrelevant for further proce-<lb/>dures. A weighted index value, the actual PBI, is<lb/> calculated by multiplying the achieved benefits<lb/> (PBQ) with the importance of the respective<lb/> needs prior to therapy (PNQ), dividing these<lb/> products by the sum of all importance items<lb/> and summing them up for all items. The PBI<lb/> ranges from 0 (no benefit) to 4 (maximal bene-<lb/>fit). A PBI score [ 1 is considered relevant; this<lb/> cut-off was based on correlations with conver-<lb/>gent criteria (unpublished data).<lb/></p>

			<p>In this study, the PBI version for patients<lb/> with allergic rhinitis (PBI-AR) was used. It<lb/> includes items on needs and benefits that are<lb/> specifically relevant for this patient group. The<lb/> PBI-AR has been validated in adult patients with<lb/> allergic rhinitis <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. For the PBI-AR, both a<lb/> global score on overall benefit and subscales<lb/> scores on different dimensions of benefit (psy-<lb/>chological burden, treatment burden, physical<lb/> symptoms, activity/physical capability) can be<lb/> computed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical Analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition to descriptive analyses (frequency,<lb/> mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile<lb/> range, range), associations of PBI-AR global<lb/> score and subscale scores with patient charac-<lb/>teristics were determined.<lb/></p>

			<p>We used the t-test for independent samples<lb/> for binary characteristics: gender; poly-versus<lb/> monoallergic patients; patients with versus<lb/> without asthma; mild versus severe rhinocon-<lb/>junctivitis; intermittent versus persistent aller-<lb/>gic rhinitis, according to the ARIA classification<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>; decrease in rhinitis symptom, yes versus<lb/> no; decrease in conjunctivitis symptoms, yes<lb/> versus no. For the latter two variables, patients<lb/> were classified into the two groups based on the<lb/> physicians&apos; judgement on symptoms at first and<lb/> second visit with the response options &apos;&apos;none&apos;&apos;,<lb/> &apos;&apos;mild&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;moderate&apos;&apos;, and &apos;&apos;severe&apos;&apos;; patients<lb/> without symptoms at first visit were excluded<lb/> from this analysis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Analyses of variance were used for compar-<lb/>isons between three groups (improvement in<lb/> well-being as rated by physicians and patients,<lb/> respectively: &apos;&apos;much better&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;somewhat better&apos;&apos;,<lb/> or &apos;&apos;unchanged&apos;&apos;). For these analyses, the sub-<lb/>groups with the response &apos;&apos;worse&apos;&apos; had to be<lb/> excluded for being too small for inclusion in the<lb/> statistical analysis (physicians: n = 4; patients:<lb/> n = 8).<lb/></p>

			<p>This was a per-protocol analysis; no missing<lb/> data were imputed. Data were analyzed using<lb/> SPSS v.22 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS</head><lb/> 
			<head>General Epidemiological Data<lb/></head>

			<p>Data were available for 346 participants. Of<lb/> these, 20 were excluded from the overall anal-<lb/>ysis due to age \ 18 years (n = 7), retrospective<lb/> documentation (n = 10), or failure to take the<lb/> birch pollen SLIT (n = 3). Another 35 patients<lb/> were excluded from the PBI analysis because<lb/> they completed the PBI at the wrong time<lb/> point, namely: (1) the PNQ was completed later<lb/> than 21 days after treatment onset (at this time,<lb/> treatment effects may already be present, which<lb/> may influence the needs rating), (2) the PNQ<lb/> was completed after the start of the birch pollen<lb/> season, (3) the PBQ was completed before the<lb/> birch pollen season, or (4) the PBQ was com-<lb/>pleted before treatment onset.<lb/></p>

			<p>Of 291 patients included in the PBI analysis,<lb/> 42 had completed neither the PNQ nor the PBQ.<lb/> Thus, 249 patients with partial or complete PBI<lb/> data remained. Of these, 4 had not completed<lb/> the PNQ, and 33 had not completed the PBQ;<lb/> for the remaining 212 patients, PBI global scores<lb/> could be calculated.<lb/></p>

			<p>Mean age of the 291 patients was 38.8 [s-<lb/>tandard deviation (SD) = 13.0] years with a<lb/> range of 18-78 years (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), 58.4% were<lb/> female, and 74.2% were diagnosed with allergic<lb/> conjunctivitis in addition to allergic rhinitis<lb/> (the latter present in 98.6%; Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).

The lowest importance was found for<lb/> the goal to &apos;&apos;be able to have a normal sex life&apos;&apos;<lb/> (34.4%). Generally, expectations related to the<lb/> reduction of physical symptoms received the<lb/> highest mean ratings from the patients, i.e. were<lb/> considered most important.<lb/></p>

			<head>Patient-Relevant Benefit<lb/></head>

			<p>Patient assessments of benefits provided by<lb/> birch pollen SLIT are detailed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The<lb/> treatment goals with the highest benefit ratings<lb/> (referring to those patients to whom the<lb/> respective goal applied) were to &apos;&apos;have confi-<lb/>dence in the therapy&apos;&apos; (has helped &apos;&apos;quite&apos;&apos; or<lb/> &apos;&apos;very much&apos;&apos; in 60.5% of patients), &apos;&apos;have an<lb/> easily applicable treatment&apos;&apos; (55.6%), &apos;&apos;be able to<lb/> breathe through my nose more freely&apos;&apos; (51.7%),<lb/> and &apos;&apos;not have sneezing impulses anymore&apos;&apos;<lb/> (51.2%).

			<head>Association of Treatment Benefit<lb/> with Other Outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>The PBI-AR global score was positively associ-<lb/>ated with an improvement in well-being as<lb/> rated by physicians and patients (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). As<lb/> stated above, the subgroup with the response<lb/> &apos;&apos;worse&apos;&apos; had to be excluded due to small sample<lb/> sizes (physicians: n = 4; patients: n = 8). The<lb/> differences between the three groups (&apos;&apos;much<lb/> better&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;somewhat better&apos;&apos;, and &apos;&apos;unchanged&apos;&apos;)<lb/> were highly significant for both physicians&apos; and<lb/> patients&apos; judgement (p \ 0.001).<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>Furthermore, the PBI-AR global score was<lb/> positively associated with the decrease in<lb/> rhinitis symptoms as rated by the physicians.<lb/> Patients whose rhinitis symptoms had<lb/> improved in the birch pollen season with SLIT<lb/> treatment compared to the previous birch pol-<lb/>len season without treatment had a signifi-<lb/>cantly higher PBI-AR score (mean PBI-<lb/>AR = 2.31, SD = 1.03, n = 165) than patients<lb/> whose rhinitis symptoms had not decreased<lb/> (mean PBI-AR = 1.70, SD = 0.92, n = 44)<lb/> (p \ 0.001).<lb/></p>

			<head>Subgroup Analyses<lb/></head>

			<p>The patient-relevant outcomes of birch pollen<lb/> SLIT as measured by the PBI-AR (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>) and its<lb/> subscales (data not shown) were not signifi-<lb/>cantly different regarding gender, concomitant<lb/> allergies (poly-vs. monoallergic patients), or<lb/> severity of rhinoconjunctivitis. Patients with<lb/> asthma showed lower treatment benefit than<lb/> patients without asthma in both PBI-AR global<lb/> scores and subscale scores. However, average<lb/> benefit in patients with asthma was well above<lb/> the cut-off value for minimal relevant benefit<lb/> (C 1). Patients with intermittent allergic rhinitis<lb/> had higher PBI-AR scores in the subscale on<lb/> &apos;&apos;physical symptoms&apos;&apos; than those with persistent<lb/> allergic rhinitis, but no significant differences<lb/> were found in the PBI-AR global score and in the<lb/> remaining subscales.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the<lb/> incremental therapeutic patient benefit from<lb/> SLIT with birch pollen extract in patients with<lb/> birch pollen-related allergic rhinoconjunctivi-<lb/>tis. In order to identify a broad spectrum of<lb/> patient-relevant needs and outcomes, the PBI<lb/> was used. Previous studies have demonstrated<lb/> its validity and feasibility in a variety of condi-<lb/>tions, including allergic rhinitis <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>.<lb/></p>
			
			<p>At baseline, patients with birch pollen<lb/> induced AR had specific and multi-faceted<lb/> treatment needs, particularly related to relief<lb/> from physical symptoms of rhinitis, as well as<lb/> regarding the ability to have normal leisure<lb/> activities and to be outdoors. Treatment goals of<lb/> patients with AR reported in previous publica-<lb/>tions include symptom reduction, better sleep,<lb/> being able to undertake normal daily activities,<lb/> and not having side effects <ref type="biblio">[17, 18]</ref>, all of which<lb/> could be confirmed by the results of the present<lb/> study.<lb/></p>

			<p>After weighting the reported benefits item-<lb/>wise by the patients&apos; individual treatment<lb/> needs, a vast majority of patients (81%) showed<lb/> an at least clinically minimum relevant benefit<lb/> (PBI C 1), and the average PBI was 2.19. This<lb/> indicates that most patients who were treated<lb/> with birch pollen SLIT during the observation<lb/> phase of this study perceived the treatment as at<lb/> least partially successful in achieving their self-<lb/>defined treatment goals, in particular with<lb/> regard to the subscales &apos;&apos;physical symptoms&apos;&apos;<lb/> and &apos;&apos;treatment burden&apos;&apos;. Consequently, the<lb/> main advantages of birch pollen SLIT treatment<lb/> from the patients&apos; perspective were shown to be<lb/> an improvement of physical symptoms and a<lb/> low burden of treatment.<lb/></p>

			<p>As the severity of AR and the combination of<lb/> AR and asthma are known to increase the<lb/> overall burden of the disease and the impact on<lb/> the patients <ref type="biblio">[17, 18]</ref>, and concomitant allergies<lb/> may reinforce the burden even further, patient<lb/> benefit was assessed in different subgroups of<lb/> patients. Regardless of the clinical profile,<lb/> patients benefited from treatment. Similar<lb/> mean PBI-AR global scores were obtained in<lb/> mono-and polyallergic patients and in patients<lb/> with mild versus severe symptoms. Patients<lb/> with asthma reported a patient-relevant benefit;<lb/> however, this benefit was lower than in patients<lb/> without asthma. In patients with persistent<lb/> allergic rhinitis, benefit was higher only with<lb/> regard to physical symptoms as compared to<lb/> patients with intermittent allergic rhinitis. The<lb/> reason for the lower response in these groups<lb/> could be a higher disease burden. As goal<lb/> achievement was rated by the patients them-<lb/>selves, patients from these subgroups may have<lb/> been more hesitant to give a very good benefit<lb/> assessment due to higher expectations on<lb/> treatment.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the results allow for the conclusion<lb/> that patients regard the birch pollen SLIT<lb/> treatment as beneficial, this non-controlled<lb/> observational study has some limitations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Effects due to other factors such as changes<lb/> in birch pollen load cannot be controlled for in<lb/> this kind of setting. However, according to data<lb/> from the German Pollen Information Service<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>, pollen load in Germany in 2013 was<lb/> markedly higher than in 2012, which supports<lb/> the hypothesis that the patient-reported symp-<lb/>tom improvement from 2012 to 2013 cannot be<lb/> attributed to a reduced pollen load. In addition,<lb/> this study aimed to assess treatment benefit of<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 2 PBI-AR global score (mean and SD) by physicians&apos; and patients&apos; judgement on improvement in well-being (second<lb/> visit)<lb/></figure>

			<p>birch pollen SLIT from the patients&apos; perspective,<lb/> which implies that all needs and benefits data<lb/> represent the subjective view of the partici-<lb/>pants. Patients may understand items on need<lb/> and benefits in different ways, and the retro-<lb/>spective benefit judgement may be subject to<lb/> recall bias <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>PBI data from 35 participants (10.7% of 326)<lb/> were excluded from analysis because data were<lb/> collected at the wrong time, possibly because<lb/> patients&apos; appointments were re-scheduled and/<lb/> or physicians and/or practice staff misremem-<lb/>bered the intended time points for assessment.<lb/> As this was a non-interventional study, observ-<lb/>ing treatment in routine medical practice, no<lb/> study site monitoring was conducted and devi-<lb/>ations from the planned assessments were to be<lb/> expected.<lb/></p>

			<p>Additional analyses-i.e. all analyses except<lb/> for the evaluation of the PBI-AR global score-<lb/>should be interpreted with caution, as in these<lb/> explorative analyses significance values were<lb/> not adjusted for multiple testing.<lb/></p>

			<p>AIT being a long-term treatment, the rec-<lb/>ommended treatment duration is at least<lb/> 3 years <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. While this study has demonstrated<lb/> patient-reported benefit of birch pollen SLIT<lb/> after one birch pollen season on treatment,<lb/> further investigation should be conducted to<lb/> evaluate sustained or long-term benefit over<lb/> more years of treatment, as indicated by exist-<lb/>ing clinical data: a clinical double-blind, pla-<lb/>cebo-controlled trial with the birch pollen SLIT<lb/> extracts used in this study showed a sustained<lb/> clinical efficacy after two seasons of treatment<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. Potentially, an increase in patient benefit<lb/> can be expected during the course of SLIT<lb/> treatment.<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>Patients with AR reported considerable patient-<lb/>relevant treatment benefit from SLIT with a<lb/> birch pollen extract after one season of treat-<lb/>ment, mainly due to a reduction of physical<lb/> symptoms and treatment burden. This holds for<lb/> different patient groups, including both poly-<lb/>and monoallergic patients and patients with<lb/> mild and severe rhinoconjunctivitis.<lb/></p>
