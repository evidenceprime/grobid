			<p>In a recent 2-year cancer bioassay conducted by the National<lb/> Toxicology Program (NTP), hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] adminis-<lb/>tered in drinking water induced small intestinal tumors in B6C3F1<lb/> mice, and tumors of the oral cavity in Fisher 344 rats; no other<lb/> treatment-related tumors were reported in either species <ref type="biblio">(NTP,<lb/> 2008b; Stout et al., 2009a)</ref>. In the small intestine, there were clear<lb/> differences between mice and rats with respect to non-neoplastic<lb/> lesions <ref type="biblio">(NTP, 2008b)</ref>. The mode of action (MOA) for the intestinal<lb/> tumors is posited to involve chronic intestinal injury leading to<lb/> long-term intestinal regenerative hyperplasia <ref type="biblio">(Thompson et al.,<lb/> 2013)</ref>. In contrast to the intestine, the oral mucosae of mice and<lb/> rats exhibited no non-neoplastic or pre-neoplastic lesions; and to<lb/> date, there is no published MOA describing Cr(VI)-induced oral<lb/> tumors in rats.<lb/></p>

			<p>As part of our research on the toxicity and carcinogenicity of<lb/> Cr(VI) by the oral route of exposure <ref type="biblio">(Kirman et al., 2012; Kopec<lb/> et al., 2012a,b; Proctor et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2011, 2012)</ref>,<lb/> we collected data to follow up on previous reports that Cr<ref type="biblio">(VI)<lb/></ref> causes microcytic hypochromic anemia <ref type="biblio">(NTP, 1996, 1997, 2007,<lb/> 2008b)</ref>. In the 90-day NTP study with drinking water concentra-<lb/>tions of $22-300 mg/L Cr(VI), microcytic hypochromic anemia<lb/> was observed in rats and mice; anemia was reported to be more se-<lb/>vere in rats than mice, but no significant sex differences in hema-<lb/>tological effects were reported <ref type="biblio">(NTP, 2007)</ref>. In the 2-year bioassay,<lb/> NTP reported hematological effects (including hemoglobin, mean<lb/> cell volume, erythrocytes) in male rats and female mice at multiple<lb/> time points, which NTP concluded were more severe and pro-<lb/>longed in rats than mice (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>) <ref type="biblio">(NTP, 2008b)</ref>. Be-<lb/>cause female rats and male mice were not evaluated, sex<lb/> differences in regard to hematological effects could not be assessed<lb/> in the 2-year NTP bioassay. The anemia did ameliorate with time,<lb/> but significant changes in some hematological markers were still<lb/> evident in the high dose group rats at one year, which was the final<lb/> time point at which hematology was evaluated in the 2-year NTP<lb/> bioassay.<lb/></p>

			<p>These anemic responses to high concentrations of Cr(VI) sug-<lb/>gest interference with iron (Fe) absorption and/or homeostasis. In<lb/> this regard, it is known that Cr(VI), Cr(V), and Cr(IV) can oxidize<lb/> ferrous iron (Fe 2+ ) to ferric iron (Fe 3+ ) <ref type="biblio">(Buerge and Hug, 1997;<lb/> Fendorf and Li, 1996)</ref>:<lb/></p>

				<formula>CrðVIÞ þ Fe 2þ $ CrðVÞ þ Fe 3þ<lb/></formula>

				<label>ðiiÞ<lb/></label>

				<formula>CrðIVÞ þ Fe 2þ $ CrðIIIÞ þ Fe 3þ<lb/></formula>

				<label>ðiiiÞ<lb/></label>

			<p>Further, it is well established that the major form of non-heme<lb/> dietary iron is Fe 3+ , which must be reduced to Fe <ref type="biblio">2+</ref> prior to absorp-<lb/>tion by enterocytes in the proximal small intestine <ref type="biblio">(Kumar et al.,<lb/> 2005; Lonnerdal, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, we hypothesize that high con-<lb/>centrations of ingested Cr(VI) may oxidize Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ and hinder<lb/> Fe 2+ absorption from the intestinal lumen. Notably, anemic effects<lb/> were not observed in rodents chronically exposed to trivalent chro-<lb/>mium [Cr(III)] <ref type="biblio">(NTP, 2008a; Stout et al., 2009b)</ref>-further suggesting<lb/> that the chemistry in formulas i, ii, iii may, at least partially, ex-<lb/>plain the anemic effects of Cr(VI).<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to this extracellular chemistry, Cr(VI) absorbed to<lb/> the bloodstream may be taken up into red blood cells (RBCs) and<lb/> reduced to Cr(III). Once inside the cell, Cr(III) can bind to ferritin<lb/> in competition with intracellular Fe <ref type="biblio">(Ani and Moshtaghie, 1992;<lb/> Wauters et al., 1978)</ref>. In contrast, Cr(III) from extracellular reduc-<lb/>tion of Cr(VI) in the blood does not readily cross the RBC mem-<lb/>brane and is thus free to compete with Fe binding to transferrin<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Ducros, 1992; Hopkins and Schwarz, 1964; Sayato et al., 1980)</ref>.<lb/> Once Cr(VI) is absorbed into the RBCs, Cr(III) is produced from<lb/> intracellular reduction of Cr(VI), and becomes trapped in the RBC,<lb/> increasing the total Cr RBC:plasma ratio. As such, there are several<lb/> ways in which high doses of Cr(VI) can cause disruption Fe metab-<lb/>olism and homeostasis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Iron plays an important role in many metabolic pathways be-<lb/>cause it is a functional component of oxygen-carrying globin pro-<lb/>teins including hemoglobin and myoglobin, cytochromes, and<lb/> enzymes that transfer electrons <ref type="biblio">(Andrews and Schmidt, 2007;<lb/> Recalcati et al., 2012)</ref>. Further, Fe is used for DNA synthesis and en-<lb/>ergy production, and as such, Fe homeostasis is tightly controlled<lb/> to ensure coordinated absorption by enterocytes, reutilization in<lb/> the macrophages, and proper distribution for erythropoiesis or<lb/> storage in hepatocytes <ref type="biblio">(Andrews and Schmidt, 2007; Recalcati<lb/> et al., 2012)</ref>. Iron is also an essential element for proper function<lb/> of the immune system; in fact, macrophages sequester Fe by differ-<lb/>ent mechanisms to contain microbial infection <ref type="biblio">(Huang, 2003;<lb/> Recalcati et al., 2012)</ref>. It has also been suggested that disruption<lb/> of Fe metabolism can potentiate oral carcinogenicity <ref type="biblio">(Binnie<lb/> et al., 1983; Prime et al., 1983; Rennie et al., 1984; Richie et al.,<lb/> 2008)</ref>. Given the importance of Fe in basic physiological processes,<lb/> disruption of Fe status and homeostasis could play a role in several<lb/> of the adverse outcomes observed with high dose Cr(VI) exposure.<lb/></p>

			<p>Recently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency<lb/> (U.S. EPA) released drinking water supply monitoring data for its<lb/> third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR3) pro-<lb/>gram; Cr(VI) was detected in 5260 drinking water samples, of<lb/> 6929 samples analyzed, at concentrations ranging from<lb/> 0.00003 mg/L, the minimal reporting level, to 0.091 mg/L, with<lb/> mean and median values of 0.0014 and 0.00019 mg/L, respectively<lb/> (USEPA, 2013). Thus, drinking water exposures to Cr(VI) in humans<lb/> are several orders of magnitude lower than those that disrupted Fe<lb/> absorption and homeostasis in rodents of the NTP bioassays <ref type="biblio">(NTP,<lb/> 2007, 2008b; Stout et al., 2009a)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Herein we evaluate the biochemical and toxicogenomic evi-<lb/>dence that Cr(VI) disrupts Fe absorption and homeostasis, as well<lb/> as evaluate pharmacokinetic data to assess dose-dependent transi-<lb/>tions in chromium disposition. This study extends our previous<lb/> analyses <ref type="biblio">(Kopec et al., 2012a,b; Thompson et al., 2011, 2012)</ref> which<lb/> described the effects of 7 and 90 days of exposure to Cr(VI) on gene<lb/> expression in the duodena of rats and mice <ref type="biblio">(Kopec et al., 2012a,b)</ref>.<lb/> Because most dietary Fe is absorbed in the proximal small intestine<lb/> and Fe homeostasis is regulated at the level of intestinal absorption<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Kumar et al., 2005; Lonnerdal, 2010; Wood and Han, 1998)</ref>, toxic-<lb/>ogenomic data from the duodenum are useful for assessing Fe<lb/> homeostasis.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Material and methods<lb/> 2.1. Animal husbandry and study design<lb/></head>

			<p>Details of the test substance, animal husbandry, and study design have been de-<lb/>scribed previously <ref type="biblio">(Thompson et al., 2011, 2012)</ref>. Briefly, Southern Research Insti-<lb/>tute (Birmingham, AL) acclimatized 4-5 week old female Fischer F344 rats and<lb/> female B6C3F1 mice (Charles Rivers Laboratories International, Stone Ridge, NY)<lb/> for a minimum of 7 days with free access to irradiated NTP-2000 wafers (Zeigler<lb/> Bros, Gardners, PA). Animals were continuously exposed to Cr(VI), administered<lb/> as sodium dichromate dihydrate (SDD), dissolved in tap water at 0, 0.3, 4, 14, 60,<lb/> 170 and 520 mg/L, corresponding to 0, 0.1, 1.4, 5, 20, 60, and 180 mg/L Cr(VI), for<lb/> 7 and 90 days (note: rats were not exposed to 14 mg/L SDD). Based on animal body<lb/> weight, water intake, and administered drinking water concentrations of Cr(VI), 90-<lb/>day average daily doses for rats and mice were calculated (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Rats and mice<lb/> were euthanized using CO 2 . All procedures were carried out with the approval of<lb/> the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Southern Research Institute.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2. Assessment of Fe levels in serum and bone marrow<lb/></head>

			<p>Serum Fe levels were measured in 10 animals from each dose group. Samples<lb/> ($0.4 ml) were collected from the retro-orbital plexus into tubes containing no<lb/> anticoagulant. The contents of the tubes were centrifuged to separate serum. Serum<lb/> Fe was measured using the FerroZine method and Cobas c501 Clinical Chemistry<lb/> Analyzer (Version 04-02; Roche Diagnostics; Indianapolis, IN). The Fe content in<lb/> bone marrow smears was also assessed in 5 animals per dose group. Gale scores<lb/> were used as semi-quantitative grading scheme to assess Fe content in bone mar-<lb/>row <ref type="biblio">(Gale et al., 1963)</ref>. In each dose group, one bone marrow smear from each ani-<lb/>mal was prepared and stained with Prussian blue to assess the presence of Fe.<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Table 1<lb/> Average daily doses of ingested Cr(VI) for rats and mice administered Cr(VI) as SDD in drinking water for 90 days.<lb/> Administered drinking water concentration, Cr(VI) (mg/L)<lb/> 0.1<lb/> 1.4<lb/> 5<lb/> 20<lb/> 60<lb/> 180<lb/> 90-Day average daily dose, Cr(VI) (mg/kg) a<lb/> Rat<lb/> 0.02<lb/> 0.21<lb/> -b<lb/> 2.90<lb/> 7.20<lb/> 20.5<lb/> Mouse<lb/> 0.02<lb/> 0.30<lb/> 1.10<lb/> 4.60<lb/> 11.7<lb/> 31.1<lb/></figure>

			<p>a Average daily doses were calculated from animal bodyweight, water intake, and administered drinking water concentrations of Cr(VI). Data for bodyweight, intake, and<lb/> doses are taken from <ref type="biblio">Thompson et al. (2011, 2012</ref>).<lb/> b Rats were not administered drinking water concentration of 5 mg/L Cr(VI).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3. Assessment of Fe and Cr levels in tissues<lb/></head>

			<p>Tissue levels of total Cr and Fe were measured in 5 animals per dose group.<lb/> Samples were shipped frozen to Brooks Rand Laboratories where approximately<lb/> 100 mg of tissue was digested in nitric acid in a controlled microwave digestion<lb/> program. Samples were then brought to a final volume of 8 mL with deionized<lb/> water. Analysis was performed using EPA Draft Method 1638 (modified) using<lb/> inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with Dynamic Reaction<lb/> Cell (DRC™) technology. Digested samples were analyzed utilizing internal stan-<lb/>dardization with rhodium. This method incorporates ionization of the sample in<lb/> an inductively-coupled RF plasma, with detection of the resulting ions by mass<lb/> spectrometer on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio. Results were presented<lb/> for total Fe in duodenum and liver and total Cr in the RBCs and plasma. The limit<lb/> of detection was 0.02 lg Cr/g tissue. Iron levels were simultaneously measured in<lb/> these tissue samples, and the limit of detection was 0.2 lg Fe/g tissue.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4. Microarray analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>For toxicogenomic analyses, duodenal samples were scraped and processed as<lb/> described previously <ref type="biblio">(Kopec et al., 2012a)</ref>. Briefly, intestinal sections were collected<lb/> and flushed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline. Duodenal sections were cut<lb/> longitudinally and the epithelium was scraped using disposable sterile plastic spat-<lb/>ulas (VWR International) into vials containing $1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,<lb/> CA) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at À80 °C and<lb/> shipped on dry ice to Michigan State University for gene expression analysis. Total<lb/> RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol with an additional acid<lb/> phenol:chloroform extraction. Isolated RNA was resuspended in RNA storage solu-<lb/>tion (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), quantified (A 260 ), and quality of each sample was as-<lb/>sessed by evaluation of the A 260 /A 280 ratio and by visual inspection of 1 lg total RNA<lb/> on a denaturing gel. Gene expression was examined using rat 4 Â 44 K Agilent<lb/> whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays (version 1, Agilent Technologies, Inc.,<lb/> Santa Clara, CA). Microarrays were scanned at 532 nm (Cy3) and 635 nm (Cy5) on<lb/> a GenePix 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Images were ana-<lb/>lyzed for feature and background intensities using GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Molec-<lb/>ular Devices).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.5. Statistical analyses<lb/></head>

			<p>Dose-related trends for tissue concentrations of total Fe were analyzed initially<lb/> using Jonckheere&apos;s test <ref type="biblio">(Jonckheere, 1954)</ref>. Then, data with a significant dose-re-<lb/>lated trend were analyzed by William&apos;s tests (parametric) or Shirley&apos;s tests (non-<lb/>parametric) <ref type="biblio">(Shirley, 1977)</ref>. If no monotone trend was observed, Dunnett&apos;s tests<lb/> (parametric) or Dunn&apos;s (nonparametric) tests were conducted. Statistical packages<lb/> used included Prism 5 for Mac (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA,<lb/> www.graphpad.com).<lb/></p>

			<p>Microarray data were normalized using a semi-parametric approach <ref type="biblio">(Eckel<lb/> et al., 2005)</ref> and the posterior probability P1(t) values were calculated using an<lb/> empirical Bayes method based on a per gene and dose basis using model-based t<lb/> values <ref type="biblio">(Eckel et al., 2004)</ref>. Gene expression data were ranked and prioritized using<lb/> |fold change| &gt; 1.5 and statistical P1(t) value &gt;0.999 criteria to identify differentially<lb/> expressed genes.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Results<lb/> 3.1. Effects on iron status<lb/></head>

			<p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, there were dose-dependent decreases of the<lb/> total Fe in the duodenum, liver, and serum of both species. Dose-<lb/>dependent changes in liver and serum were slightly more pro-<lb/>nounced in rats than mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B and C</ref>). We also examined the<lb/> bone marrows for Fe content by Prussian blue staining. Overall,<lb/> there were no changes in Fe content of bone marrows for rats<lb/> administered drinking water concentrations of 0-20 mg/L Cr(VI),<lb/> in one animal of the 20 mg/L Cr(VI) group and in one of the control<lb/></p>

Effects are shown for total Fe in the duodenum (A), liver (B), and<lb/> serum (C) in rats and mice by their 90-day average daily doses of Cr(VI). The average daily doses of Cr(VI) were based on animal bodyweight, water intake, and administered<lb/> drinking water concentrations of Cr(VI).

Moderate Fe content (Grade 3)<lb/> indicated that many small Fe particles were present in reticulum cells throughout<lb/> bone marrow fragments (100Â).<lb/></figure>

			<p>animals, the Fe content was slight to moderate (grade 2-3)<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Iron content that was slight (grade 2) indicated small Fe<lb/> particles that were sparsely distributed in the bone marrow, which<lb/> were observed by 100Â magnification. Moderate Fe content (grade<lb/> 3) indicated that many small Fe particles were present in reticulum<lb/> cells throughout bone marrow fragments. In several rats adminis-<lb/>tered 60 mg/L Cr(VI), the Fe content was slight to moderate (grade<lb/> 2-3), in all animals of the highest dose group (180 mg/L Cr(VI)), the<lb/> Fe content was slight (grade 2) (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, there<lb/> were fewer bone marrow macrophages with blue staining (i.e. Fe)<lb/> in the 180 mg/L Cr(VI)-treated rat as compared to the control ani-<lb/>mal. In contrast, Prussian blue staining of bone marrow from<lb/> Cr(VI)-treated mice were unremarkable (data not shown).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2. Effects of Cr(VI) on genes involved in iron homeostasis<lb/></head>

			<p>Three genes involved in Fe transport and absorption from the<lb/> intestinal lumen were significantly altered by Cr(VI) exposure.<lb/> Duodenal cytochrome b (DCYBT, Cybrd1) and divalent metal trans-<lb/>porter 1 (DMT1, Slc11a2) are expressed on the apical membrane of<lb/> villus enterocytes and function together to absorb non-heme Fe in<lb/> the diet. DCYBT is responsible for reducing luminal Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ ,<lb/> which is subsequently transported into the enterocyte via DMT1.<lb/></p>

			<p>Heme-based Fe is acquired by transport of dietary heme across<lb/> the villus enterocyte via heme carrier protein 1 (HCP1, Slc46a1).<lb/> Slc11a2 was elevated in both species at both time points in a<lb/> dose-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). After 90 days of exposure, Slc11a2<lb/> was induced $4-fold in rats at 180 mg/L Cr(VI), and $1.6-fold in<lb/> mice. Cybrd1 expression was decreased in mice at both day 8 and<lb/> 91, but was only significantly reduced in rats at day 8. Slc46a1<lb/> expression was reduced in both species at both time points (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1, Tfr1) is primarily involved in Fe<lb/> uptake from the blood and is thus usually expressed on the baso-<lb/>lateral membrane. Ferrotransferrin (i.e. Fe-bound transferrin) in<lb/> the blood binds to TFR1 thereby stimulating endocytosis and cellu-<lb/>lar Fe absorption. Like Slc11a2, Tfr1 expression was increased in a<lb/> dose-dependent manner in both species at day 8 and day 91. At<lb/> day 8, the expression of Tfr1 was quite robust in both species with<lb/> increases ranging 4-to 5-fold (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). By day 91, Tfr1 induction was<lb/> higher in rats than mice.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two genes expressed on the basolateral enterocyte membrane<lb/> that are involved in the export of duodenal Fe were also altered<lb/> by Cr(VI). Ferroportin (Slc40a1) is responsible for the export of<lb/> Fe 2+ into the blood where it is subsequently oxidized to Fe 3+ by<lb/> hephaestin (Heph) so that it can bind to transferrin. Slc40a1 was<lb/> down-regulated in both species at day 8, unchanged in rats at<lb/></p>

Fold change expression of select genes in the rat and mouse duodena after 7 and 90 days of exposure to Cr(VI) in drinking water. Open and filled symbols represent<lb/> genes typically expressed on the apical and basolateral epithelial surfaces, respectively.

(2012a,b) for methods related to microarray analysis.<lb/></figure>

			<p>day 91, and down-regulated in mice at day 91 (albeit insignifi-<lb/>cantly). Heph was down-regulated in both species at both time<lb/> points (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to these membrane-bound enzymes/genes, heme<lb/> oxygenase 1 (Hmox1), which is also involved in Fe regulation,<lb/> was elevated at day 91 in mice but not rats (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Heme oxygen-<lb/>ase is involved in the catabolism of heme to CO, Fe 2+ , and biliver-<lb/>din. Thus, elevation in Hmox1 might have led to increased<lb/> cellular Fe, which might partially explain why Slc11a2 and Tfr1<lb/> expression was less affected in mice than rats at day 91 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/> Diagram 1 summarizes the aforementioned gene changes in rats<lb/> and the potential influence of Cr(VI) on Fe homeostasis.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3. Cr(VI) disposition<lb/></head>

			<p>Based on concentrations of total Cr measured in RBCs and plas-<lb/>ma, RBC:plasma ratios were assessed in rats and mice for the dif-<lb/>ferent dose groups. The ratio of Cr concentration in RBCs and<lb/> plasma has long been used in studies as a biomarker of systemi-<lb/>cally absorbed Cr(VI) <ref type="biblio">(Alexander and Aaseth, 1995; Buttner and<lb/> Beyersmann, 1985; Gray and Sterling, 1950)</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>,<lb/> the RBC:plasma ratio increased in both species in a dose-depen-<lb/>dent manner, but the increase appears at lower doses in rats than<lb/> in mice. The RBC:plasma ratio was above unity (&gt;1) in rats admin-<lb/>istered drinking water concentrations of 20 mg/L Cr(VI) and higher<lb/> (dose of P2.90 mg/kg). In mice, the RBC:plasma ratio was &gt;1 at<lb/> drinking water concentrations of 60 mg/L Cr(VI) and higher (dose<lb/> of P11.70 mg/kg).<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>Previous studies have shown that high concentrations of Cr(VI)<lb/> induce anemia in rodents <ref type="biblio">(NTP, 1996, 1997, 2007, 2008b)</ref>, which<lb/> may be explained by the disruption of Fe homeostasis by Cr(VI).<lb/> This current study is the first to demonstrate Fe depletion from<lb/> the duodenum, liver, serum, and bone marrow following exposure<lb/> to high concentrations of Cr(VI) in drinking water (Figs. <ref type="figure">1 and 2</ref>;<lb/> Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Moreover, Cr(VI) altered the expression of several key<lb/> genes involved in Fe homeostasis (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>; Diagram 1). Many of<lb/> the duodenal gene changes in response to Cr(VI) are consistent<lb/> with previously reported duodenal gene changes in rats placed<lb/> on Fe-deficient diets. <ref type="biblio">Collins et al. (2005)</ref> studied genomic re-<lb/>sponses in the duodena of rats placed on Fe-deficient diets at dif-<lb/>ferent stages of development (suckling through adulthood), and<lb/> reported increases in Slc11a2, Cybrd1, Tfr1 and Hmox1, decreases<lb/> in Heph, and no change in Slc40a1. Among those genes induced<lb/> by an Fe-deficient diet, Slc11a2 and Tfr1 were induced by Cr(VI)<lb/> in both species; and Hmox1 was induced by Cr(VI) in mice. The<lb/> notable exception was Cybrd1, which was decreased by Cr(VI) in<lb/> both species. Consistent with changes in rats fed an Fe-deficient<lb/> diet for 9 weeks <ref type="biblio">(Collins et al., 2005)</ref>, mRNA levels of Heph were<lb/> decreased in both rats and mice exposed to Cr(VI). With regard<lb/> to ferroportin (Slc40a1), the lack of change in rats and mice at<lb/> day 91 is also consistent with the findings of <ref type="biblio">Collins et al. (2005)</ref>.<lb/> Thus, with the notable exception of Cybrd1, the gene changes in<lb/> rats and mice were generally consistent with dietary Fe deficiency.<lb/> These findings support the hypothesis that high concentrations of<lb/> Cr(VI) in the intestinal lumen can oxidize luminal Fe 2+ to Fe 3+<lb/> thereby hindering Fe absorption. Indeed, we have shown that the<lb/> high concentrations of Cr(VI) used in the 2-year NTP bioassay are<lb/> not entirely reduced to Cr(III) by gastric fluid and thus high levels<lb/> of Cr(VI) are expected to be present in the intestinal lumen (Proctor<lb/> Diagram 1. Summary of gene expression changes in rats and potential influence of<lb/> Cr on Fe Homeostasis. Ferric iron (Fe 3+ ) in the intestinal lumen is reduced to ferrous<lb/> iron (Fe 2+ ) by cytochrome b reductase (DCYBT, Cyprd1). Fe 2+ then enters the apical<lb/> membrane of the enterocyte via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1, Slc11a2). Fe 2+<lb/> can then be stored in ferritin or enter the bloodstream at the basolateral membrane<lb/> via ferroportin (Slc40a1). Fe 2+ is then oxidized to Fe 3+ by hephaestin (Heph) so that it<lb/> can bind to transferrin. Diferric transferrin binds transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1) and<lb/> mediates Fe uptake via endocytosis. Heme is taken up by heme carrier protein 1<lb/> (HCP1, Slc46a1) and subsequently catabolized to Fe 2+ , CO, and the antioxidant<lb/> biliverdin by heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1). Genes that were generally up or down<lb/> regulated in F344 rats by Cr(VI) are colored red or green, respectively. The presence<lb/> of Cr(VI, IV, and V) can oxidize Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ (shown in the lumen), which may hinder<lb/> Fe 2+ absorption. Once transported into the enterocyte through anion transporters,<lb/> Cr(VI) can be reduced by cytoplasmic reductants (R C , e.g. ascorbate, GSH) to Cr(III).<lb/> Cr(III) can bind to certain Fe-binding proteins. Cr(VI, V, and IV) may also compete<lb/> with Fe 3+ for reductants in the lumen (R L , e.g. ascorbate, cysteine).<lb/></p>

The average daily doses of Cr(VI) were based on animal<lb/> bodyweight, water intake, and administered drinking water concentrations of<lb/> Cr(VI). RBC:plasma ratio was above unity (&gt;1) in rats at drinking water concentra-<lb/>tions P20 mg/L Cr(VI) (equivalent to P2.90 mg/kg). In mice, the RBC:plasma ratio<lb/> was &gt; 1 at drinking water concentrations P60 mg/L Cr(VI) (equivalent to<lb/> P11.70 mg/kg).<lb/> et al., 2012). There are other important genes expressed primarily<lb/> in the liver that regulate Fe homeostasis including hepcidin and<lb/> transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2). In this study, toxicogenomic analyses<lb/> were conducted on duodenal samples and thus hepcidin and TFR2<lb/> expressions were not quantified. Studies that assess gene<lb/> expression in liver samples of animals treated with Cr(VI) will be<lb/> informative to further describe Fe perturbations from Cr(VI)<lb/> exposures.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to the apparent disruption of Fe absorption from the<lb/> intestinal lumen, we observed dose-dependent changes in Cr dis-<lb/>position based on Cr RBC:plasma ratios calculated for both species<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). If Cr(VI) enters the bloodstream, it can be transported into<lb/> RBCs, reduced to Cr(III), and subsequently bind to heme. Hence,<lb/> intracellular Cr(III) will be trapped for the lifespan of the RBC.<lb/> The RBC lifespan is 120, 66, and 42 mean days in humans, rats,<lb/> and mice, respectively <ref type="biblio">(Derelanko, 1987; Shemin and Rittenberg,<lb/> 1946; Van Putten, 1958)</ref>. If Cr(VI) is reduced extracellularly to<lb/> Cr(III) in the blood or if Cr(III) enters the blood, Cr will not readily<lb/> accumulate in RBCs; thus, concentrations of Cr in plasma and RBCs<lb/> remain approximately equal. We observed concentrations of total<lb/> Cr in RBCs exceeding that of plasma at P20 and P60 mg/L Cr(VI)<lb/> in rats and mice, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Our previous kinetics re-<lb/>search suggests that the reducing capacity of rat stomach contents<lb/> reaches saturation at $20 mg Cr(VI)/L in drinking water, and is<lb/> greatly exceeded at 60 and 180 mg/L <ref type="biblio">(Proctor et al., 2012)</ref>. We have<lb/> previously shown that plasma GSH/GSSG ratios of rats and mice<lb/> were significantly decreased following 90 days of exposure at<lb/> P60 mg/L Cr(VI) <ref type="biblio">(Thompson et al., 2012)</ref>, which may further<lb/> suggest the presence of Cr(VI) in the blood. Taken together,<lb/> multiple lines of evidence suggest a dose-dependent change in Cr<lb/> disposition occurring at approximately 20-60 mg/L in rodents.<lb/></p>

			<p>Disruption of Fe homeostasis by Cr(VI) may play a role in the<lb/> toxic responses observed in Cr(VI) drinking water bioassays.<lb/> Although the relationship between Fe depletion and adverse out-<lb/>comes has not been evaluated specifically in chronic rodent stud-<lb/>ies, we examined the findings of the 2-year NTP bioassay and our<lb/> 90-day study <ref type="biblio">(NTP, 2008b; Thompson et al., 2012)</ref> which may be<lb/> associated with Fe deficiency (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). In both studies, many out-<lb/>comes potentially associated with Fe deficiency as outlined in<lb/> Table <ref type="table">3</ref> were observed; effects potentially related to Fe deficiency<lb/> were more consistently observed in female as compared to male<lb/> rats, and in rats compared to mice. In addition, these effects poten-<lb/>tially related to Fe were mostly all high dose effects, occurring at<lb/> P20 mg/L Cr(VI). Although the incidence of chronic liver inflam-<lb/>mation, which might be related to Fe depletion, was significantly<lb/> increased at 5 mg/L in females, the severity was increased at<lb/> P60 mg/L. Thus, the perturbation of Fe homeostasis by Cr(VI)<lb/> and the associated health effects appear to be limited to high dose<lb/> exposure.<lb/></p>

Moreover, saliva may play an<lb/> important role in oral carcinogenesis (pull refs from Section 5:<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Wallenius 1965, 1966; Naglar and Dayan (2006)</ref>, <ref type="biblio">Vered et al.<lb/> (2010), Smiler (1970)</ref>, <ref type="biblio">Stich et al. (1982)</ref>). It is possible that<lb/> Fe-deficiency reported herein may have played a role for the<lb/> rat oral tumors. Experimentally-induced anemia, for example,<lb/> has been shown to potentiate the oral carcinogenicity of 4-nitro-<lb/>quinoline 1-oxide <ref type="biblio">(Prime et al., 1983)</ref>, and several chemicals that<lb/> induce oral cancers in rats, also cause microcytic anemia. For<lb/> example, <ref type="biblio">Ramot et al. (2012)</ref> recently observed that gavage<lb/> doses of 3,3 0 -4,4 0 -tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB) induced oral tu-<lb/>mors in rats in the oral mucosa adjacent to molar teeth in nasal<lb/> section III, which is the same location as oral tumors induced by<lb/> Cr(VI) in the 2-year NTP bioassay. TCAB has been shown to cause<lb/> microcytic normochromic responsive anemia in male Sprague-<lb/>Dawley rats <ref type="biblio">(NTP, 2010)</ref>. Although TCAB and Cr(VI) are not<lb/> known to act by the same MOA, microcytic anemia might con-<lb/>tribute to formation of rat oral tumors observed following expo-<lb/>sure to both chemicals. Also in humans, conditions of anemia<lb/> such as Plummer-Vinson syndrome have been linked to oral can-<lb/>cer <ref type="biblio">(Kumar et al., 2005; Lucenteforte et al., 2009; Richie et al.,<lb/> 2008)</ref>. Yet based on the currently available data, it is not feasible<lb/> to discern effects caused by Cr(VI) directly from those that may<lb/> be induced or exacerbated by Fe deficiency at high doses. It may<lb/> be useful to consider future studies in rodents that investigate<lb/> the potential role of long-term Fe disruption and depletion in<lb/> context of Cr(VI) exposure. Finally, it cannot be ruled out that<lb/> other general signs of poor health such as reduced bodyweight<lb/> gain and water intake might have contributed to the outcomes<lb/> observed in the 2-year NTP bioassay (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Herein we have described biochemical and molecular support<lb/> for previously observed Cr(VI)-induced microcytic anemia in ro-<lb/>dents. Moreover, Cr(VI)-induced Fe deficiency may have caused<lb/> or contributed to other adverse effects of Cr(VI) observed in ani-<lb/>mal bioassays. Most adverse effects potentially related to Fe defi-<lb/>ciency occur at Cr(VI) drinking water concentrations that<lb/> correspond with a shift in the toxicokinetics of Cr(VI) absorption,<lb/> occurring in rats at P20 mg/L. Because Fe depletion mainly oc-<lb/>curred at very high concentrations of Cr(VI) in drinking water,<lb/> adverse outcomes associated with disruption of Fe homeostasis<lb/> are not likely at typical U.S. drinking water exposures, recently<lb/> reported to range from $0.00003 mg/L to 0.091 mg/L, with med-<lb/>ian value of 0.0002 mg/L (USEPA, 2013). Based on these data,<lb/> this study provides evidence of perturbations in Fe homeostasis<lb/> from exposures to high concentration of Cr(VI) (P20 mg/L) in<lb/> drinking water. The findings of this study may be useful to guide<lb/> experimental designs of future studies to evaluate Fe homeosta-<lb/>sis disturbance and potentially related adverse effects from pro-<lb/>longed exposures to Cr(VI).</p>
