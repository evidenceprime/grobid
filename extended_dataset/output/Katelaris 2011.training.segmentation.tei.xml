			<front>Nasal allergies in the Asian-Pacific population: Results <lb/>from the Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey <lb/>Constance H. Katelaris, B.S., Ph.D., 1 Christopher K.W.

The Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey was undertaken to further clarify the prevalence of <lb/>physician-diagnosed nasal allergies (NAs), impact on quality-of-life (QOL), existing treatment paradigms and gaps, and NA medications currently used in <lb/>treatment. <lb/>Methods: Thirty-three thousand three hundred seventy-eight households were screened for individuals, Ն4 years old, with a physician diagnosis of AR or <lb/>NA and either symptoms or treatment in the past 12 months. Standardized questionnaires were used to make comparisons across regions. A total of 1043 adults <lb/>and 192 children were included in the survey. <lb/>Results: Nine percent of participants were diagnosed with AR with two of three responding that their NAs were seasonal in nature. Nasal congestion was <lb/>the most common and bothersome symptom of AR. Most participants reported that AR impacted their QOL with nearly one-half citing impairments in <lb/>school/work performance/productivity. Sleep disturbances, secondary to AR, were also shown to be appreciable. Two-thirds of patients took medication for their <lb/>AR. Less than one-quarter of survey respondents reported taking an intranasal corticosteroid and the satisfaction rate was similar to that of over-the-counter <lb/>medications. The most common reasons cited for dissatisfaction were related to inadequate efficacy and bothersome side effects. <lb/>Conclusion: AR appears to be extremely common across Asia-Pacific nations. Many individuals with AR suffer from symptoms that reduce QOL and <lb/>treatment gaps exist with current therapies. Through identification of disease impact and highlighting treatment gaps, clinicians may better understand and <lb/>treat AR, leading to improvements in overall patient satisfaction and QOL. <lb/>(Am J Rhinol Allergy 25, S3-S15, 2011; doi: 10.2500/ajra.2011.25.3674) <lb/>A llergic rhinitis (AR) is a highly prevalent chronic respiratory <lb/>illness that has been linked to multiple comorbid conditions, <lb/>including asthma. 1,2 Poorly controlled AR has been shown to cause <lb/>significant patient discomfort and impairments in work productivity, <lb/>school performance, social interactions, and sleep similar to other <lb/>chronic conditions. 3-9 <lb/>Allergic disorders are estimated to affect some 1.4 billion people <lb/>globally and the prevalence continues to increase and now has be-<lb/>come the most common chronic medical condition worldwide requir-<lb/>ing active intervention. 10,11 Recent data from Asia-Pacific suggests <lb/>that there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of AR within <lb/>this region within the past 10 years that exerts a significant economic <lb/>burden. 12-17 Although it is unknown why the prevalence of AR is <lb/>increasing, experts have suggested that it is likely a consequence of <lb/>the changing environment, better hygiene and decreased infections, <lb/>and genetic susceptibilities. 18 <lb/>Consistent with treatment guidelines, treatment is usually based on <lb/>patient&apos;s age and severity of symptoms. 19 Intranasal corticosteroids <lb/>(INCSs) are well regarded as the most effective treatment options for <lb/>AR and should be first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate disease. 19,20 <lb/>Immunotherapy is another option as a disease modifying therapy for <lb/>AR. Moderate-to-severe disease not responsive to INCSs should be <lb/>treated with the addition of second-line therapies, including antihis-<lb/>tamines, decongestants, cromolyn, leukotriene receptor antagonists, <lb/>and nonpharmacologic therapies. 19 <lb/>Effective AR treatment has been shown to improve quality of life <lb/>(QOL) and may even lower the risk of new asthma cases developing <lb/>in adults. 21 Despite these therapeutic benefits, AR often goes unrec-<lb/>ognized by physicians, resulting in inadequate control of symptoms. <lb/>This fact is underscored by a recent survey of Spanish individuals <lb/>with clinically confirmed symptoms of AR that showed that one-third <lb/>of survey participants were not aware that they had the condition, <lb/>and almost one-half had not been diagnosed by their physician. 22 <lb/>Several large-scale studies and surveys (e.g., Allergies in America, <lb/>Allergies in Latin America, and International Study of Asthma and <lb/>Allergy in Childhood [ISAAC]), have attempted to ascertain the true <lb/>From the 1 Department of Medicine, University of Western Sydney, Campbelltown <lb/>Hospital, Sydney, Australia, 2 Department of Medicine, The Chinese University of <lb/>Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, 3 Department <lb/>of Otorhinolaryngology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, <lb/>4 <lb/>Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, College of Medicine, <lb/>Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, 5 Department of Otolaryngology, Yong Loo Lin <lb/>School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 6 Fe del Mundo <lb/>Medical Center and Department of Internal Medicine, Manila Adventist Medical <lb/>Center, Philippines, 7 Rhinology Department, National Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital, <lb/>Hanoi, Vietnam, 8 Care Sinus Snoring ENT Center, Gleneagles Medical Center, Singapore, <lb/>9 <lb/>Hospital Raja Permaisuri Bainun, Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, 10 Department of Otorhinolar-<lb/>yngology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, 11 Abt SRBI, Inc., New York, <lb/>New York, 12 Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery, Samsung Medical <lb/>Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, 13 Department of <lb/>Otorhinolaryngology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 14 Section of Rhi-<lb/>nology, St. Luke&apos;s Medical Center, Quezon City, Philippines, 15 Division of Clinical Im-<lb/>munology and Allergy, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennes-<lb/>see, and 16 Australian School of Advanced Medicine at Macquarie University, Sydney <lb/>Medical School at University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia <lb/>Supported by Nycomed, a research-based pharmaceutical company <lb/>The survey was developed and conducted by Abt SRBI, an international survey research <lb/>organization <lb/>C.H.

			<body>D O <lb/>N O <lb/>T <lb/>C O <lb/>P Y <lb/>prevalence of diagnosed AR, impact on QOL, and current treatment <lb/>gaps within the United States, Latin America, and the European <lb/>Union. 23-26 However, the authors are unaware of any studies that <lb/>have attempted to ascertain, in the same study population, an assess-<lb/>ment of the prevalence of diagnosed AR, its patient-perceived impact <lb/>on QOL, current prescribing patterns, and treatment gaps within <lb/>Asia-Pacific. Given this dearth of data, the Allergies in Asia-Pacific <lb/>Survey was undertaken in an attempt to assess the prevalence of <lb/>physician-diagnosed AR and its impact on QOL, as well as existing <lb/>treatment paradigms and patterns and gaps associated with AR in an <lb/>effort to aid clinicians in optimally treating this highly prevalent <lb/>disease. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey <lb/>Persons appropriate for inclusion in this survey were individuals <lb/>Ն4 years old, residing in Australia, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, <lb/>Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. These <lb/>individuals must have reported currently experiencing or being <lb/>treated for AR and having been diagnosed by a physician as having <lb/>AR, nasal allergies (NAs), hay fever, or sinus disease within the past <lb/>1 year. It is important to note that individuals included in the study <lb/>were not required to have a skin-prick test to confirm the diagnosis of <lb/>AR although individuals were asked whether or not they had a <lb/>skin-prick test performed to confirm the diagnosis. Terms other than <lb/>AR were included because AR may not have been the common term <lb/>understood or communicated to patients in the regions where the <lb/>interview took place. Thus, a range of more or less synonymous terms <lb/>was provided to ensure that the survey captured everyone with the <lb/>target condition. However, for the purposes of clarity, the term AR <lb/>will be used in this article to identify patients included in this survey. <lb/>Fieldwork was conducted between December 2009 and January <lb/>2010. Telephone and in-person interviewing were used depending on <lb/>the most appropriate mode of screening and interviewing in a par-<lb/>ticular region. Translations of the questionnaire were performed in <lb/>each country where English was not the dominant language. In some <lb/>countries the questionnaire was translated into multiple languages. <lb/>Back translation was not performed; however, the advisors in each <lb/>country reviewed and validated the translation against the English <lb/>version of the questionnaire. Most of the interviews were conducted <lb/>in urban areas because of the low telephone penetration and lack of <lb/>interviewing infrastructure in rural areas of most of the Asian-Pacific <lb/>regions. It is important to note that in South Korea, traditional tele-<lb/>phone survey methods were not possible because of cultural sensi-<lb/>tivities in this region and individuals were included in the survey <lb/>only through physician referral, a methodology used previously in <lb/>other surveys assessing chronic conditions in South Korea. Given the <lb/>fact that a different methodological approach was used for South <lb/>Korea compared with the other eight countries, the South Korean data <lb/>were excluded from this analysis. This was done to reduce the pos-<lb/>sibility of imparting bias into the overall results because patients with <lb/>AR referred to an allergist or otolaryngologist may have had more <lb/>severe symptoms and hence have been a more severe population <lb/>compared with the population from the other countries that did not <lb/>require physician referral as a criterion for inclusion into the survey. <lb/>The findings from South Korea are intended to be published in a <lb/>separate article. <lb/>Sample weights were developed to correct for sampling bias and <lb/>differences between eligible patients screened and eligible patients <lb/>actually interviewed. An age and gender correction ensured that the <lb/>interviewed population was similar to the screened population of <lb/>allergy sufferers. Cross-tabulation and frequency weighting were <lb/>used in all analyses to determine critical survey outcomes. <lb/>The maximum expected sampling error for a simple random sam-<lb/>ple of 1043 cases (e.g., the adult Asia-Pacific sample without South <lb/>Korea) was Ϯ2.7 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. The <lb/>maximum expected sampling error for a simple random sample of <lb/>192 pediatric cases was Ϯ6.3 percentage points at the 95% confidence <lb/>level. The maximum expected sampling error for a simple random <lb/>sample for region-specific samples from Asia-Pacific was Ϯ5.7 per-<lb/>centage points for sample sizes of 300, and Ϯ9.8 percentage points for <lb/>sample sizes of 100 at the 95% confidence level. It should be noted that <lb/>household sampling for face-to-face interviews was conducted with a <lb/>more complex design using cluster sampling so design effects may <lb/>increase actual sampling variance compared with simple random <lb/>sampling. <lb/>Development of Survey Questionnaires <lb/>Validated and standardized questionnaires specific to ascertaining <lb/>the prevalence, impact, and treatment gaps associated with AR, un-<lb/>fortunately, do not currently exist. Thus, through the use of survey <lb/>analysts from the research firm Abt SRBI, Inc., along with expert <lb/>physicians in the AR field from Asia-Pacific, patient and health care <lb/>professional questionnaires were developed that accurately collected <lb/>relevant information on AR within the Asian-Pacific regions sur-<lb/>veyed. Because formally validated questionnaires do not currently <lb/>exist to obtain such data, the questions included in this survey have <lb/>been standardized to survey questions previously used in previous <lb/>surveys on AR, which include several thousand survey participants <lb/>across North and South America. 24-26 <lb/>The developed questionnaires focused on general health; AR trig-<lb/>gers and symptoms; and effects of AR on QOL including sleep, <lb/>impact on daily life, mood, absenteeism, and presenteeism. Perceived <lb/>effectiveness, expectations of treatment outcome, and side effects of <lb/>over-the-counter (OTC; all medications available without a prescrip-<lb/>tion) and prescription AR medications were also assessed. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Study Participation and Demographics <lb/>A total of 33,378 households were screened to obtain 1235 com-<lb/>pleted interviews across the eight regions. There were 1043 adults and <lb/>192 caregivers, with pediatric patients who had AR, who completed <lb/>the survey. An overview of the study design and number of house-<lb/>holds screened and surveyed, by region, can be found in Table 1. It is <lb/>important to note that the population surveyed and presented in this <lb/>table were those individuals actually diagnosed with AR (NA, hay <lb/>fever, or sinus disease) by a physician. <lb/>As can be seen in Table 2, there were more female subjects included <lb/>in the survey compared with men. The mean age of children included <lb/>in the survey was 12.3 Ϯ 2.77 years and the mean age for adults <lb/>included in this survey was 36.9 Ϯ 13.3 years. The majority of respon-<lb/>dents reported that they were educated to a secondary or university <lb/>level. Most survey participants had either private or public insurance. <lb/>Less than 20% of respondents reported that they were not insured. <lb/>This demographic pattern was generally representative of the overall <lb/>population in Asia-Pacific. <lb/>Prevalence and Patterns of Diagnosed AR in <lb/>Asia-Pacific <lb/>The Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey found that 8.7% of respon-<lb/>dents across eight Asia-Pacific regions surveyed had a physician <lb/>diagnosis of AR, NA, sinus disease, or hay fever (Fig. 1). The preva-<lb/>lence of diagnosed AR ranged from 2.5% in the Philippines to 13.2% <lb/>in Australia. The vast majority of participants reported being diag-<lb/>nosed with either NA or AR (84% of adults and 87% of children). The <lb/>average age of doctor diagnosis of AR in adults was 26 years and 9 <lb/>years for the children included in the survey. <lb/>The majority of adult survey respondents reported having been <lb/>diagnosed with AR by an otolaryngologist (41%) or general practice <lb/>S4 <lb/>September-October 2011, Vol. 25, No. 5 (Suppl 1) <lb/>D O <lb/>N O <lb/>T <lb/>C O <lb/>P Y <lb/>physician (41%). Children were most commonly diagnosed with AR <lb/>by a general practitioner. Not surprisingly, in the majority of in-<lb/>stances, these were the same types of physicians that continued to <lb/>treat these individuals for their AR after initial diagnosis. The major-<lb/>ity of individuals who were surveyed reported never having a diag-<lb/>nostic test to confirm the presence of AR. Forty-one percent of adults <lb/>and 43% of children surveyed reported having had a diagnostic test <lb/>(either skin or blood test) performed to confirm the diagnosis AR. On <lb/>average, there was roughly an equal percentage of the survey popu-<lb/>lation that reported having had a skin-prick test (ϳ10%), blood test <lb/>(ϳ14%), or both (ϳ16%). <lb/>Nearly two of three adults and over one-half of children with AR in <lb/>Asia-Pacific reported having seasonal allergies (Fig. 2, A and B). <lb/>There was considerable variation among regions. Participants from <lb/>China reported having the highest incidence of seasonal allergies <lb/>whereas those from Singapore had the highest reported incidence of <lb/>perennial AR (Fig. 2 A). It is worth mentioning that despite the <lb/>majority of survey participants citing that their AR was seasonal in <lb/>nature, the major allergy trigger reported by the entire survey pop-<lb/>ulation was dust, a typical perennial allergen (49% of adults and 56% <lb/>of caregivers of children with AR; data not shown) potentially indi-<lb/>cating that individuals are reporting a seasonal exacerbation second-<lb/>ary to a perennial allergy or nonspecific hyperresponsiveness. <lb/>The other most commonly cited AR trigger was climate/humidity. <lb/>When participants were asked during what particular months of the <lb/>year is AR the worst, the results were concordant between adults and <lb/>children surveyed, with both groups having reported that October <lb/>through December were the months in which their AR was most <lb/>severe. <lb/>When survey participants were asked to assess their general overall <lb/>health, over one-half of adults (56%) and nearly two of three caregiv-<lb/>ers of children (68%) rated general overall health as good to excellent. <lb/>Only 6% of adults and 4% of caregivers of children with AR rated <lb/>their health as poor or very poor (data not shown). <lb/>When asked about concomitant medical conditions, one in five <lb/>adults and one in four children were reported having been diagnosed <lb/>with asthma in addition to AR (Fig. 3). The region with the lowest <lb/>proportion of adults with asthma and AR was Vietnam whereas <lb/>Taiwan and Hong Kong were the regions with the lowest reported <lb/>incidence of concomitant asthma in children. The region with the <lb/>highest proportion of adults with concomitant asthma was Aus-<lb/>tralia and the region with the highest reported incidence of con-<lb/>comitant asthma in children was the Philippines. It is worth men-<lb/>tioning that among those individuals who reported concomitant <lb/>asthma, nearly 50% of children and 60% of adults with asthma <lb/>reported having asthma symptoms or an asthma exacerbation <lb/>within the past year. <lb/>Symptoms Associated with AR in Asian-Pacific <lb/>Patients <lb/>Individuals included in the Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey <lb/>were asked whether they still suffer from AR or if their AR <lb/>symptoms have abated over time. The overwhelming majority of <lb/>adults (96%) and children (96%) reported that they are still trou-<lb/>bled by their AR. When asked about the frequency with which they <lb/>experienced specific symptoms, adults reported most commonly <lb/>experiencing nasal congestion (45%) and repeated sneezing (43%) <lb/>every day or most days when their AR was most severe (data not <lb/>Table 1 Adult and children survey population and study sampling frame <lb/>Population <lb/>Adults, adolescents, and children diagnosed with nasal <lb/>allergies or allergic rhinitis, symptomatic or <lb/>being treated for nasal allergies in the past 12 mo <lb/>Sampling Frame <lb/>Telephone* and in-person # screening of <lb/>national or major city sample of households <lb/>Interview Length <lb/>Range, 10 -90 min; <lb/>mean, 34.9 min <lb/>Region <lb/>No. of Households Screened <lb/>Completed Sample <lb/>Adults (Children) <lb/>Australia <lb/>3534* <lb/>262 (41) <lb/>China <lb/>19,580* <lb/>301 (24) <lb/>Hong Kong <lb/>2118* <lb/>71 (29) <lb/>Malaysia <lb/>491# <lb/>73 (27) <lb/>Philippines <lb/>1285# <lb/>80 (20) <lb/>Singapore <lb/>2002# <lb/>88 (12) <lb/>Taiwan <lb/>1780* <lb/>79 (21) <lb/>Vietnam <lb/>2588# <lb/>89 (18) <lb/>Total <lb/>33,378 <lb/>1043 (192) <lb/>*Participants screened via telephone. <lb/>#Participants screened via in-person interview. <lb/>Table 2 Survey participants demographics <lb/>Parameter <lb/>Percent <lb/>Sex <lb/>Male <lb/>45.9 <lb/>Female <lb/>54.1 <lb/>Age <lb/>Children (4-17 yr of age) <lb/>12.3 yr <lb/>Adults (Ն18 yr) <lb/>36.9 yr <lb/>Education level of adult respondents and caregivers <lb/>of children <lb/>No school <lb/>2.0 <lb/>Primary education <lb/>15.5 <lb/>Secondary education <lb/>44.0 <lb/>University <lb/>34.9 <lb/>Postgraduate <lb/>0.1 <lb/>Do not know <lb/>0.3 <lb/>Refused <lb/>0.7 <lb/>Other <lb/>2.6 <lb/>Health insurance types <lb/>Private <lb/>27.0 <lb/>Public <lb/>26.2 <lb/>Both <lb/>27.1 <lb/>None <lb/>18.2 <lb/>Do not know <lb/>1.1 <lb/>Refused to answer <lb/>0.5 <lb/></body>

Caregivers of children with AR reported that their chil-<lb/>dren most commonly experienced runny nose (47%) and nasal <lb/>congestion (43%) most frequently during the days in which their <lb/>AR was the most severe (data not shown). The AR symptom <lb/>assessed as most bothersome was nasal congestion, followed <lb/>closely by repeated sneezing in the adult and pediatric survey <lb/>population. A full list of the most bothersome symptoms reported <lb/>Figure 1. Prevalence of allergic rhinitis overall and by spe-<lb/>cific Asian-Pacific regions. <lb/>Figure 2.

Almost all AR sufferers (and caregivers of children <lb/>with AR) said that the discomfort during an allergy attack is not <lb/>something they can ignore. Close to one-half (46%) of adults and <lb/>slightly fewer caregivers of children with AR (39%) said that the <lb/>discomfort, secondary to AR, is something that they can not tolerate <lb/>without relief. The region where adults perceived the greatest dis-<lb/>comfort secondary to AR was China and the lowest was Singapore. A <lb/>similar finding was observed for children (data not shown). <lb/>QOL Impact of AR in Asian-Pacific Patients <lb/>The Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey also assessed the impact of NA <lb/>symptoms on QOL. Almost all adults and children with AR reported <lb/>that the condition had an impact on their daily life when symptoms <lb/>were at their worst (89% of adults and 82% of children; data not <lb/>shown). Over one-third of adult and caregivers with children re-<lb/>ported that AR affected their lives to at least a moderate degree when <lb/>symptoms were most severe (Table 3). The region where the impact of <lb/>AR was the greatest for adults and children was the Philippines. <lb/>Singapore and Malaysia reported the least daily impact of AR on <lb/>daily life in adults and Taiwan reported the least daily impact in <lb/>children (Table 3). <lb/>When adults and caregivers of children with AR were asked to <lb/>identify specifically how symptomatic AR impacted their daily activ-<lb/>ities, nearly one-half of the entire survey population reported that <lb/>their AR hindered them from performing well at work/school. Ad-<lb/>ditional limitations cited were the inability to have or play with pets, <lb/>limitations in participating in outdoor activities, and limitations in <lb/>participation in indoor activities. A complete by-region breakdown of <lb/>these data can be found in Table 3. <lb/>Nearly 50% of survey participants cited that their AR interfered at <lb/>some level with their work/school-related efforts with over one in <lb/>five survey participants having reported that their AR interfered with <lb/>their daily work/school activities and caused them to miss work/ <lb/>school (Table 3). When survey participants were asked to actually rate <lb/>their work/school productivity/output on a percentage basis in the <lb/>presence and absence of severe AR symptoms, these data showed <lb/>Ͼ20% reduction in work/school output/performance when AR <lb/>symptoms were most severe. Interestingly, the results were fairly <lb/>consistent across all individual regions for both adults and children. <lb/>A complete by-region breakdown of these data can be found in <lb/>Table 3. <lb/>The Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey attempted to quantify the <lb/>impact of AR on sleep-related measures. Over 70% of the adult study <lb/>population reported being at least somewhat troubled by at least one <lb/>sleep indictor (e.g., falling asleep, awakening during the night, and <lb/>perception of lack of restful night sleep) secondary to their NA <lb/>symptoms whereas ϳ60% of caregivers of children with AR reported <lb/>being troubled by at least one sleep indicator (data not shown). When <lb/>the impact of AR on these specific sleep indicators was assessed, <lb/>the impact was surprisingly similar across these three sleep mea-<lb/>sures and between adults and children. A full overview of the <lb/>impact that AR had on sleep outcomes is presented overall and by <lb/>country in Table 3. <lb/>Current Disease and Treatment Patterns: Perceptions <lb/>and Paradigms <lb/>When NA sufferers were asked how well their AR symptoms have <lb/>been controlled over the past 4 weeks, nearly one-half, to slightly over <lb/>one-half, of adult respondents and caregivers of children with AR <lb/>assessed their symptoms of completely or well controlled. Moreover, <lb/>13% of adults and 10% of caregivers of children with AR assessed <lb/>their NA symptoms as poorly or not controlled (Table 4). <lb/>With regard to physician visits for AR, nearly two-thirds of adults <lb/>and nearly three of four children reported seeing a physician for their <lb/>AR within the past with a smaller percentage reporting having seen <lb/>an AR specialist (Table 4). Interestingly, only 58% of adults reported <lb/>they saw a physician for AR despite reporting that their AR was not <lb/>controlled at all (data not shown). <lb/>When survey participants were asked whether there were truly <lb/>effective treatments currently available to control their disease, over <lb/>one-half of the survey population somewhat to strongly agreed with <lb/>Table 3 Impact of allergic rhinitis on various quality of life measures (percent surveyed adults [children]) <lb/>All <lb/>Regions <lb/>Australia <lb/>China <lb/>Hong <lb/>Kong <lb/>Malaysia <lb/>Philippines <lb/>Singapore <lb/>Taiwan Vietnam <lb/>Moderate-to-severe impact on <lb/>daily life <lb/>38 (38) <lb/>43 (56) <lb/>48 (50) <lb/>16 (21) <lb/>12 (19) <lb/>67 (74) <lb/>12 (17) <lb/>28 (14) <lb/>34 (39) <lb/>Frequently experienced emotions/feelings during allergy season <lb/>Depressed <lb/>16 (12) <lb/>13 (20) <lb/>31 (25) <lb/>4 (7) <lb/>4 (0) <lb/>14 (20) <lb/>5 (0) <lb/>9 (5) <lb/>10 (11) <lb/>Tired <lb/>27 (24) <lb/>41 (44) <lb/>27 (17) <lb/>17 (21) <lb/>11 (7) <lb/>36 (30) <lb/>9 (17) <lb/>15 (10) <lb/>24 (33) <lb/>Miserable <lb/>13 (11) <lb/>16 (29) <lb/>19 (13) <lb/>6 (3) <lb/>0 (0) <lb/>15 (15) <lb/>5 (0) <lb/>9 (5) <lb/>8 (6) <lb/>At least some impact/limitations on lifestyle caused by allergic rhinitis <lb/>Doing well in work/school <lb/>46 (45) <lb/>41 (42) <lb/>66 (75) <lb/>37 (41) <lb/>22 (22) <lb/>48 (70) <lb/>20 (33) <lb/>38 (14) <lb/>51 (72) <lb/>Having/playing with pets <lb/>31 (32) <lb/>25 (27) <lb/>45 (67) <lb/>13 (24) <lb/>41 (30) <lb/>28 (35) <lb/>21 (17) <lb/>25 (19) <lb/>27 (28) <lb/>Outdoor activities <lb/>36 (33) <lb/>40 (34) <lb/>48 (42) <lb/>18 (24) <lb/>26 (19) <lb/>38 (50) <lb/>21 (42) <lb/>22 (10) <lb/>39 (50) <lb/>Indoor activities <lb/>27 (22) <lb/>24 (17) <lb/>34 (29) <lb/>28 (21) <lb/>12 (19) <lb/>28 (55) <lb/>13 (17) <lb/>28 (10) <lb/>36 (17) <lb/>Percent reduction in work productivity (school) when allergy symptoms were at their worst compared with when allergy symptoms were <lb/>absent <lb/>25 (23) <lb/>31 (36) <lb/>31 (23) <lb/>20 (19) <lb/>16 (10) <lb/>31 (30) <lb/>22 (18) <lb/>10 (19) <lb/>12 (11) <lb/>Allergy interference with work <lb/>(school)-yes response <lb/>50 (44) <lb/>47 (61) <lb/>71 (54) <lb/>24 (35) <lb/>33 (30) <lb/>53 (58) <lb/>47 (33) <lb/>39 (29) <lb/>38 (39) <lb/>Missed and interfered <lb/>21 (23) <lb/>16 (36) <lb/>35 (21) <lb/>3 (14) <lb/>10 (9) <lb/>28 (42) <lb/>23 (25) <lb/>11 (10) <lb/>15 (22) <lb/>Interfered only <lb/>25 (13) <lb/>24 (15) <lb/>32 (29) <lb/>18 (14) <lb/>19 (4) <lb/>24 (5) <lb/>18 (0) <lb/>28 (19) <lb/>21 (11) <lb/>Missed work/school only <lb/>4 (8) <lb/>7 (10) <lb/>4 (4) <lb/>3 (7) <lb/>4 (17) <lb/>1 (11) <lb/>6 (8) <lb/>0 (0) <lb/>2 (6) <lb/>Moderately-to-extremely troubled with sleep because of allergic rhinitis symptoms <lb/>Falling asleep <lb/>41 (37) <lb/>28 (27) <lb/>53 (54) <lb/>17 (28) <lb/>53 (30) <lb/>48 (70) <lb/>26 (17) <lb/>23 (19) <lb/>75 (72) <lb/>Waking up during the night <lb/>38 (34) <lb/>29 (24) <lb/>50 (46) <lb/>11 (21) <lb/>40 (22) <lb/>45 (70) <lb/>27 (25) <lb/>13 (19) <lb/>71 (67) <lb/>Lack of good night&apos;s sleep <lb/>42 (37) <lb/>29 (27) <lb/>55 (58) <lb/>21 (21) <lb/>49 (26) <lb/>48 (55) <lb/>31 (17) <lb/>19 (24) <lb/>71 (83) <lb/></body>

These data show that approx-<lb/>imately two-thirds of the overall survey population reported taking <lb/>some type of medication to treat their AR symptoms. The Philippines <lb/>had the highest proportion of people reporting taking some type of <lb/>prescription medication for their disease and Hong Kong had the <lb/>lowest proportion of patients taking some type of medication for their <lb/>AR. The reported use of prescription medication was approximately <lb/>one and one-half times greater than that of OTC use among those <lb/>adults and children surveyed (Table 4). Slightly Ͼ10% of the overall <lb/>survey population reported taking some type of homeopathic remedy <lb/>(e.g., herbals) to treat their AR symptoms (Table 4). Homeopathic <lb/>treatment usage was the highest in Taiwan and the lowest in Hong <lb/>Kong. <lb/>When immunotherapy use was assessed, nearly one in four people <lb/>reported having used subcutaneous immunotherapy to treat their <lb/>disease. There was almost a two times greater reported sublingual <lb/>immunotherapy use in both adults and children compared with sub-<lb/>cutaneous immunotherapy use.

It is worth <lb/>mentioning that Hong Kong had the fewest proportions of respon-<lb/>dents that perceived these efficacy shortcomings. <lb/>Discontinuation of INCS therapy overall, and by region, was also <lb/>assessed. These results show that nearly three of five adults and one <lb/>of two caregivers reported that an INCS product was discontinued <lb/>(Table 5). As illustrated in Fig. 6, major reasons for respondents <lb/>reporting discontinuing their INCS product was caused by effective-<lb/>ness wearing off over time, lack of acceptable efficacy, and unpleasant <lb/>side effects. Interestingly, cost was only cited by a minority of adults <lb/>surveyed (2%) and was not listed by caregivers of children with AR <lb/>as a reason for discontinuing their INCS product. <lb/>To further assess the perception of side effects, survey respondents <lb/>were asked whether side effects with INCS products are less bother-<lb/>some compared with other available AR medication. In response to <lb/>this question, only slightly over one-third of adults and one-quarter of <lb/>caregivers of children with AR reported that side effects with INCS <lb/>products are less bothersome than other medication used to treat AR <lb/>(Table 5). Moreover, one-quarter of adults and 28% of caregivers of <lb/>children with AR reported that they are unsure whether INCS prod-<lb/>ucts are safe for long-term use (Table 5). When the specific types of <lb/>side effects experienced by users of INCS products were assessed, the <lb/>majority of survey participants reported that retrograde drainage into <lb/>the esophagus was the most frequently occurring side effect associ-<lb/>ated with their INCS medication. Other side effects reported by adults <lb/>and caregivers of children with AR included bad taste, drying feeling, <lb/>uncomfortable spray volume, and burning sensation. A full list of <lb/>commonly experienced side effects in allergies in Asia-Pacific popu-<lb/>lation can be found in Fig. 7. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>AR is generally recognized as the most common chronic respiratory <lb/>disorder worldwide. 27 The ISAAC survey, along with publications <lb/>from Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma, have recently re-<lb/>ported epidemiological and prevalence data for allergic respiratory <lb/>diseases in Asia-Pacific, South Korea, and Thailand. 12-14 However, <lb/>prevalence estimates reported from ISAAC are limited to two age <lb/>cohorts (6-7 years and 13-14 years). Although these data provide <lb/>directional prevalence and incidence of data on the epidemiological <lb/>features of AR and asthma, they are limited because individuals were <lb/>only required to have symptomatology consistent with these diseases <lb/>and not confirmed by a physician. By contrast, the data from the <lb/>Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey were obtained from individuals who <lb/>actually had a physician diagnosis of AR. Moreover, this is the first <lb/>study, in which the authors are aware, that ascertained prevalence, <lb/>patient-assessed symptomatology, impact, and treatment paradigms <lb/>of AR among patients in Asia-Pacific within the same study. <lb/>The data show that nearly 10% of the Asia-Pacific population <lb/>surveyed had diagnosed AR. Although this is lower than the pub-<lb/>lished estimates of AR for Asia-Pacific, which have been estimated to <lb/>be as high as 45%, it is important to keep in mind that in this survey <lb/>Figure 6. most common reasons why (A) adults and (B) children and adolescents discontinued use of an intranasal corticosteroid nasal spray. <lb/>Figure 7. Reported side effects after intranasal corticosteroid use in (A) <lb/>Asian-Pacific adults and (B) Asian children and adolescents. <lb/>S10 <lb/>September-October 2011, Vol. 25, No. 5 (Suppl 1) <lb/>D O <lb/>N O <lb/>T <lb/>C O <lb/>P Y <lb/>patients actually needed to have been diagnosed with AR to be <lb/>eligible to participate in the survey. The author&apos;s recognize that is a <lb/>conservative approach and does not provide information of the true <lb/>prevalence of AR but rather only provides information on the prev-<lb/>alence of diagnosed AR. By contrast, other estimates only required a <lb/>survey participant to have symptoms consistent with the disease <lb/>within the past year. 28 Because the survey was mostly performed in <lb/>urban areas, one could speculate that factors such as a hygienic <lb/>environment, higher diagnosis rate due to higher density of special-<lb/>ists, more pollution, etc. could potentially overestimate the prevalence <lb/>of AR-this, however, did not seem to be the case. In fact, the data <lb/>from the Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey are consistent with previ-<lb/>ously published estimates for AR in South Korea as well as Austra-<lb/>lia. 29,30 Additionally, the data presented here are consistent and in the <lb/>range of the diagnosed AR population from the United States, Can-<lb/>ada, and Latin America when using the same criteria of a physician <lb/>diagnosis of AR as a clinical validation of the self-reported health <lb/>condition. 24,26,31 Hence, it is important to recognize that the appar-<lb/>ently discordant prevalence estimates between this survey and <lb/>ISAAC do not necessarily mean that the survey data presented here <lb/>are flawed, but rather that the rates of physician diagnosis of AR are <lb/>likely low. <lb/>These survey data showed that the worst months for AR exacerba-<lb/>tions were October through December. Although the authors do not <lb/>have a definitive reason as to why these months were perceived by <lb/>AR patients as ones in which their AR symptoms were most severe, <lb/>one explanation could be that these months immediately follow the <lb/>rainy season in most regions surveyed, which may contribute to an <lb/>increase in native flora resulting in higher pollen counts during the <lb/>October through December months. Another possible reason for this <lb/>finding may be related to the fact that changes in temperature and <lb/>humidity can act as triggers for the nonspecific hyperresponsiveness <lb/>or hyperreactivity and not because of AR itself. <lb/>The types of symptoms experienced by NA suffers as well as the <lb/>impact on their daily lives were highly concordant with other studies <lb/>reporting the impact on QOL and treatment gaps that currently exist <lb/>in the treatment of AR. For example, the most bothersome symptoms <lb/>reported by this survey population included nasal congestion, sneez-<lb/>ing, runny nose, and headaches, which were consistent with those <lb/>reported in other studies. 4,6,26,31,32 <lb/>It is well established that AR has a profound impact on QOL. Not <lb/>only do people with AR complain of what some consider as &quot;nuisance <lb/>symptoms,&quot; they also have significant limitations in daily activities <lb/>and limitations in social functioning as well as impaired work per-<lb/>formance. 21,33-38 The data presented here are concordant with other <lb/>published data from the region and also show that almost all patients <lb/>with diagnosed AR reported that their condition had some impact on <lb/>their daily lives. 39,40 It is worth mentioning that Singapore survey <lb/>participants reported that AR symptoms had the least daily impact on <lb/>daily life. Although the authors have no definitive explanation for this <lb/>finding, one may speculate that given the fact that this is the richest <lb/>country of all surveyed that individuals homes and workplaces are <lb/>perhaps more allergen free and thus individuals are less likely to <lb/>come into contact with exacerbating allergens. Alternatively, this <lb/>region had the highest use of disease-modifying subcutaneous im-<lb/>munotherapy, likely ascribed to the healthiness of the country and, by <lb/>extension, access to comprehensive health care. <lb/>Another finding was the fact that the region that reported the <lb/>highest subcutaneous immunotherapy usage was Singapore whereas <lb/>China reported the overall highest use of sublingual immunotherapy. <lb/>Although the author&apos;s do not have an exact reason for this finding, <lb/>one could speculate that Singapore has health care practices similar to <lb/>western medicine practices in the United States and United Kingdom <lb/>where subcutaneous immunotherapy is used quite frequently in se-<lb/>vere cases of AR. China, by contrast, uses more of the traditional <lb/>Chinese medicine approach to treating disease. As such, one could <lb/>speculate that the sublingual approach to immunotherapy treatment <lb/>in this region could be perceived as more akin to other traditional <lb/>Chinese medicine treatment modalities, thus providing a rationale for <lb/>this finding. <lb/>Sleep impairment is another significant problem for patients with <lb/>AR, rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis. 33 Although chronic sleep <lb/>disturbance has been linked to more severe pathologies, the impact of <lb/>AR on sleep quality remains an underrecognized and undertreated <lb/>component of AR morbidity. 2,24,34,41-49 Nasal congestion, one of the <lb/>common and most bothersome AR symptoms identified in this sur-<lb/>vey, has been associated with sleep-disordered breathing and is <lb/>thought to be a key cause of sleep impairment. 5,32 The data presented <lb/>here show that nearly a significant number of adults and children <lb/>with AR reported either difficulty in falling asleep, awakening during <lb/>the night, or the lack of a restful night&apos;s sleep. These data were, for the <lb/>most part, highly concordant across all regions surveyed giving the <lb/>authors confidence that these overall findings were not spurious and <lb/>simply driven by an overestimated result in one or two regions within <lb/>Asia-Pacific. Moreover, these data are concordant with other data <lb/>published on the relationship between impaired sleep quality and <lb/>uncontrolled AR. 4,34,50,51 <lb/>The frequent and burdensome symptoms of AR as well as impaired <lb/>sleep can significantly affect allergy sufferers&apos; lives and work produc-<lb/>tivity in the form of absenteeism and presenteeism. 38,52-54 The data <lb/>presented here show that individuals with AR had a Ͼ20% decrease <lb/>in productivity between days when they have no allergy symptoms <lb/>and days when their allergy symptoms are at their worst. Interest-<lb/>ingly, these data are consistent with the data from the Allergies in <lb/>America Survey as well as recently published data from Latin Amer-<lb/>ica. 24,26,34 Like in the case of the sleep data presented here, these data <lb/>significantly contribute to the body of evidence showing the far-<lb/>reaching consequences of AR and for the first time provide and actual <lb/>quantitative impact of AR on work performance in the Asian-Pacific <lb/>population. <lb/>The current study also investigated treatment patterns and the role <lb/>of NA medications in treatment of AR, including patient perspectives <lb/>on both effectiveness and bothersome side effects associated with <lb/>these medications. These data showed that nearly three of four survey <lb/>participants have seen a physician within the past year for their AR <lb/>with nearly 60% reporting seeing a specialist for their disease. This is <lb/>not completely surprising given the fact that almost all NA sufferers <lb/>said that discomfort during an allergy attack could not be ignored, <lb/>with nearly one-half of participants citing that that the discomfort is <lb/>something that they can not tolerate. These data were supported by <lb/>the fact that the majority of individuals in this survey took some type <lb/>of medication to treat their AR symptoms, with over one-half report-<lb/>ing having taken some type of prescription medication to treat their <lb/>disease. <lb/>What was surprising, however, was that only a minority of indi-<lb/>viduals reported taking an INCS product. Although on initial review <lb/>of these data may seem surprising, this was similar to the INCS usage <lb/>observed in Latin America and only slightly less compared with the <lb/>United States and Canadian experience. 24,26,31,34 Initially, we specu-<lb/>lated that that the likely reason for underuse of INCS products in this <lb/>region was related to cost, given the fact that in certain areas in the <lb/>Asia-Pacific, INCS prescriptions can be up to 20 times more expen-<lb/>sive than the first-and second-generation antihistamines. 12 Surpris-<lb/>ingly, however, it appeared to be caused by dislike of nasal sprays <lb/>and side effects. The dislike for nasal spray products is not totally <lb/>surprising given the fact that there is a considerable amount of data <lb/>regarding patient preference with INCS products as well as intranasal <lb/>migraine therapies that have shown that patient preference attributes <lb/>are a key driver to patient acceptance and adherence. 55-58 Moreover, <lb/>these data are concordant with other studies that looked at sensory <lb/>attributes that patients found unpleasant. 24,59-61 For example, Ma-<lb/>hedevia and colleagues found that lack of aftertaste was the most <lb/>important attribute of an &quot;ideal INCS product,&quot; followed by no <lb/>aftertaste, throat rundown and nose run-out, and that all of these <lb/></body>

			<body>D O <lb/>N O <lb/>T <lb/>C O <lb/>P Y <lb/>attributes contributed to patient acceptance and, by extension, patient <lb/>adherence to INCS therapy, suggesting that patient preference may <lb/>be an important driver in increasing patient acceptance and adher-<lb/>ence to intranasal NA medications. 62,63 <lb/>In addition to assessing current treatment patterns for AR in Asia-<lb/>Pacific, treatment gaps with AR medications were also analyzed. The <lb/>majority of individuals who reported taking an INCS product re-<lb/>ported that their INCS product relieved most of their AR symptoms, <lb/>with less than one-third of participants reporting that that they were <lb/>very satisfied with their INCS treatment. One reason for this low <lb/>satisfaction rate for INCS therapy could be the fact that patients with <lb/>AR expect a high amelioration of their nasal symptoms. When asked <lb/>the expected overall percentage symptom relief after taking an INCS <lb/>product, respondents stated that they expected upward of an 85% <lb/>reduction in AR symptoms in order for them to consider that the <lb/>therapy was successful. When reasons for discontinuing an INCS <lb/>product was assessed, the major reasons cited were lack of perceived <lb/>effectiveness specifically related to lack of 24-hour control of symp-<lb/>toms as well as diminution of effect with chronic use and side effects. <lb/>Thus, an AR medication that is effective in reducing severity of all <lb/>nasal symptoms associated with AR (e.g., rhinorrhea, nasal conges-<lb/>tion, sneezing, and itching) may more adequately meet a patient&apos;s <lb/>perception of an effective product leading to increased persistence <lb/>and compliance. <lb/>One additional benefit of the Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey data <lb/>set was that it enabled an assessment if intracountry differences. <lb/>Although most data across Asia-Pacific were similar in terms of QOL <lb/>impact of AR, the region that reported the highest and lowest impact <lb/>of AR on daily life was the Philippines and China, respectively. It is <lb/>not totally surprising that the Philippines reported both the highest <lb/>QOL impact of AR and the highest medication usage for their disease, <lb/>supporting that patients that have a disease with a considerable <lb/>impact on daily life are likely to seek out treatments to reduce the <lb/>burden of their disease. <lb/>When individual region treatment patterns for INCS use were <lb/>assessed, individuals from the Philippines had one of the highest <lb/>expectations for relief of AR symptoms and had the highest overall <lb/>satisfaction rates with INCS products. Despite this high overall sat-<lb/>isfaction rate, this region also had the highest proportion of patients <lb/>that reported an INCS effectiveness decreased with chronic use. Ad-<lb/>ditionally, this was the region that reported that medications used to <lb/>treat AR (e.g., OTC and immunotherapy) actually had a better side <lb/>effect profile compared with other currently available INCS products. <lb/>As a follow-up study, it may be worth assessing treatment gaps <lb/>associated with other classes of medications (e.g., antihistamines and <lb/>nasal decongestants) and if the specific types and brands of AR <lb/>medications currently approved in these particular regions drove the <lb/>differences in treatment expectations and treatment gaps with INCS <lb/>products. An additional area of study is why the overall survey <lb/>population had a relatively low reported usage of subcutaneous <lb/>immunotherapy, which was not appreciably different from the over-<lb/>all reported usage of INCS. <lb/>In conclusion, data from the Allergies in Asia-Pacific Survey have <lb/>identified the impact of AR on individuals with this chronic disease as <lb/>well as having identified a number of treatment paradigms and <lb/>treatment gaps that currently exist in Asia-Pacific. It is the authors&apos; <lb/>belief that these data will contribute to a better understanding of the <lb/>true burden of AR and provide a basis for physicians to provide better <lb/>education to patients about their condition and treatment options, <lb/>which may ultimately lead to better treatment outcomes for patients <lb/>with AR. <lb/></body>
