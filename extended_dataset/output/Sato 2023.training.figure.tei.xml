            <figDesc>Biliary drainage<lb/> and diagnostic ERCP are essential features of PCC<lb/> diagnosis and treatment. Previous reports concern-<lb/>ing PCC have focused mainly on surgical resec-<lb/>tion and presurgical factors, and few reports have<lb/> emphasized the importance of factors associated with<lb/> ERCP. Repeated and inappropriate drainage may trig-<lb/>ger cholangitis, which increases postoperative morbidity<lb/> and interrupts chemotherapy. Identifying the drainage-<lb/>related risks associated with PCC will help those per-<lb/>forming ERCP determine what should be done and what<lb/> must be avoided in the primary drainage and diagnosis<lb/> of suspected PCC.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Overall survival of patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Overall survival (OS) of 104 perihilar cholangiocarcinoma<lb/> patients based on the Kaplan-Meier method. (a) Median survival time (MST) was 599 days. (b) Patients with drainage-related cholangitis had a<lb/> shorter OS than those without cholangitis (MST: 514 days vs. 970 days, p = 0.0002, log-rank test). (c) Patients who underwent surgical resection<lb/> had a longer OS than those who did not (MST: 893 days vs. 512 days, p = 0.0004, log-rank test). (d) Patients with Bismuth type IIIa/IV had a<lb/> shorter OS than patients with Bismuth type I/II/IIIb (MST: 578 days vs. 893 days, p = 0.0230, log-rank test)</figDesc>
