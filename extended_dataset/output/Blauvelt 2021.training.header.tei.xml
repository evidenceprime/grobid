	<div type="abstract">IMPORTANCE Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory skin disease with<lb/> an unmet need for treatments that provide rapid and high levels of skin clearance and itch<lb/> improvement.<lb/> OBJECTIVE To assess the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib vs dupilumab in adults with<lb/> moderate-to-severe AD.<lb/> DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Heads Up was a 24-week, head-to-head, phase 3b,<lb/> multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled clinical trial<lb/> comparing the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib with dupilumab among 692 adults with<lb/> moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for systemic therapy. The study was conducted<lb/> from February 21, 2019, to December 9, 2020, at 129 centers located in 22 countries across<lb/> Europe, North and South America, Oceania, and the Asia-Pacific region. Efficacy analyses<lb/> were conducted in the intent-to-treat population.<lb/> INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 and treated with oral upadacitinib, 30 mg once<lb/> daily, or subcutaneous dupilumab, 300 mg every other week.<lb/> MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was achievement of 75% improvement<lb/> in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) at week 16. Secondary end points were<lb/> percentage change from baseline in the Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (weekly<lb/> average), proportion of patients achieving EASI100 and EASI90 at week 16, percentage change<lb/> from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS at week 4, proportion of patients achieving EASI75 at week<lb/> 2, percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) at week 1, and Worst<lb/> Pruritus NRS (weekly average) improvement of 4 points or more at week 16. End points at week<lb/> 24 included EASI75, EASI90, EASI100, and improvement of 4 points or more in Worst Pruritus<lb/> NRS from baseline (weekly average). Safety was assessed as treatment-emergent adverse events<lb/> in all patients receiving 1 or more dose of either drug.<lb/> RESULTS Of 924 patients screened, 348 (183 men [52.6%]; mean [SD] age, 36.6 [14.6] years)<lb/> were randomized to receive upadacitinib and 344 were randomized to receive dupilumab<lb/> (194 men [56.4%]; mean [SD] age, 36.9 [14.1] years); demographic and disease characteristics<lb/> were balanced among treatment groups. At week 16, 247 patients receiving upadacitinib<lb/> (71.0%) and 210 patients receiving dupilumab (61.1%) achieved EASI75 (P = .006). All ranked<lb/> secondary end points also demonstrated the superiority of upadacitinib vs dupilumab,<lb/> including improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS as early as week 1 (mean [SE], 31.4% [1.7%] vs<lb/> 8.8% [1.8%]; P &lt; .001), achievement of EASI75 as early as week 2 (152 [43.7%] vs 60 [17.4%];<lb/> P &lt; .001), and achievement of EASI100 at week 16 (97 [27.9%] vs 26 [7.6%]; P &lt; .001). Rates<lb/> of serious infection, eczema herpeticum, herpes zoster, and laboratory-related adverse<lb/> events were higher for patients who received upadacitinib, whereas rates of conjunctivitis<lb/> and injection-site reactions were higher for patients who received dupilumab.<lb/> CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE During 16 weeks of treatment, upadacitinib demonstrated<lb/> superior efficacy vs dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, with no new safety<lb/> signals.<lb/></div>
