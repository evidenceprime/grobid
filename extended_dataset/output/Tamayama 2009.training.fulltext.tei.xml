			<p>Allergic rhinitis has been recognised as a burden to<lb/> both health care systems and society in Europe 1 and<lb/> the U.S. <ref type="biblio">2</ref> 18.7% of Europeans 3 and 9.9-16% of Ameri-<lb/>cans <ref type="biblio">4</ref> are estimated to be suffering from the disease.<lb/> This is similar in Japan as well. Allergic rhinitis in a<lb/> form of cedar pollinosis is one of the most common<lb/> illnesses, of which prevalence is estimated to be as<lb/> high as <ref type="biblio">19</ref>.7% of the nation. <ref type="biblio">5</ref> This means one in five<lb/> Japanese suffers allergic symptoms from winter to<lb/> spring every year, during which cedar pollens scatter<lb/> in the air. Other seasonal rhinitis caused by various<lb/> allergens and perennial allergic rhinitis also affect the<lb/> nation. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> Allergic rhinitis is not a fatal disease, but its<lb/> symptoms such as sneezing, itchy eyes or stuffy nose<lb/> deteriorate the quality of life (QOL).<lb/></p>

			<p>The Practical Guideline for the Management of Al-<lb/>lergic Rhinitis in Japan <ref type="biblio">6</ref> was published by an expert<lb/> committee, in which clinical stratification of allergic<lb/> rhinitis symptoms and severity (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) is clearly de-<lb/>fined for the purpose of standardization of practice<lb/> and research. Although the guideline proposes a<lb/> Japanese Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Question-<lb/>naire (JRQLQ) in order to evaluate outcomes in<lb/> terms of QOL, <ref type="biblio">7</ref> utility weights, which enable out-<lb/>comes evaluation in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life<lb/> Years (QALYs) by the level of severity of symptoms<lb/> have not been established. A utility weight is a value<lb/> from 0 to 1, which is attached to various health stat-<lb/>uses. By combining it with survival time in changing<lb/> health statuses, life expectancy is adjusted into<lb/> QALYs taking QOL into account. For example, one<lb/> year survival suffering from severe symptoms with<lb/> F i g . 1 Cl i n i c a l s t r a t i f i c a t i o n o f a l l e r g i c r h i n i t i s s y mp t o ms a n d s e v e r i t y .

			<p>utility weights of 0.5 is considered as an outcome<lb/> gain of 0.5 QALY. Such a calculation of QALYs with<lb/> utility weights allows a better comparison of out-<lb/>comes of QOL deteriorating disease treatments, and<lb/> it is recommended in conducting economic evalu-<lb/>ation of health care intervention. <ref type="biblio">8</ref> In Japan, 0.89 for<lb/> seasonal allergic rhinitis and 0.97 for perennial aller-<lb/>gic rhinitis as the average of patients with various lev-<lb/>els of symptoms using EQ-5D <ref type="biblio">9</ref> only was reported by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Monden and Ogino (2005) 10</ref> to date.<lb/></p>

			<p>This paper aims to derive utility weights for allergic<lb/> rhinitis by the level of the standard clinical stratifica-<lb/>tion of severity. Since high morbidity of cedar pollino-<lb/>sis raises a concern about its impact on health care<lb/> resources in Japan <ref type="biblio">11,12</ref> and elsewhere, <ref type="biblio">13,14</ref> the results<lb/> could facilitate economic evaluations using a recom-<lb/>mended outcomes measurement, QALYs, <ref type="biblio">8</ref> which<lb/> could contribute to more efficient management of the<lb/> disease.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/></head>

			<p>In deriving utility weights, choosing whose prefer-<lb/>ence is to be elicited is essential. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> The objective of<lb/> deriving utility weights, that is, its use for cost-utility<lb/> analysis, imposes a gold standard that preference of<lb/> the general public should be elicited. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> However, util-<lb/>ity weights are sometimes drawn from patients or ex-<lb/>perts in practice, because it is often difficult for<lb/> healthy individuals to have an accurate grasp of their<lb/> health status subjected to a specific disease without<lb/> experience. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> In the context of this study, &quot;suffering<lb/> from rhinitis&quot; or its symptoms are both common and<lb/> easy to understand, and therefore, we choose to ask<lb/> the preference of representative samples among the<lb/> general public.<lb/></p>

			<p>Technically, there are two approaches in eliciting<lb/> preference for health status as utility weights. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> One<lb/> approach is the use of multi-attribute health status<lb/> classification systems, <ref type="biblio">19</ref> as Monden and Ogino<lb/> (2005) <ref type="biblio">9</ref> used EQ-5D, while the other is the use of<lb/> techniques, which directly measure the preference of<lb/> individuals. We choose direct measurement in this<lb/> study, since the former approach is suitable for ques-<lb/>tioning patients. There are three most widely used<lb/> techniques in measuring preferences directly: the rat-<lb/>ing scale and its variants (RS), the standard gamble<lb/> (SG) and the time trade-off (TTO). <ref type="biblio">18</ref> RS is the easiest<lb/> and quickest to implement, but it is also known as an<lb/> erratic measure. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> Therefore, RS is often used as an<lb/> introductory or complementary to SG or TTO. Al-<lb/>though theoretical superiority of the SG against TTO<lb/> is established in regards to the axioms of the von<lb/> Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory, <ref type="biblio">20</ref> TTO is con-<lb/>sistently found much easier to respond to compared<lb/> to SG by respondents. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> Therefore, the choice be-<lb/>tween them usually depends on the context of the<lb/> study. <ref type="biblio">18<lb/></ref> In order to apply these techniques to representa-<lb/>tive samples of the general public, the mode of ques-<lb/>tioning needs to be chosen. It is known that risk or<lb/> probability communication, which is required for SG,<lb/> is better achieved by an interview along a dialogue, <ref type="biblio">21<lb/></ref> but recruiting representative interviewees from the<lb/> general public is hard to implement. On the contrary,<lb/></p>

			<p>the TTO instrument can be devised as a self-<lb/>administered questionnaire, <ref type="biblio">22</ref> which can be used for<lb/> a community survey with random sampling. There-<lb/>fore, we choose the TTO complemented by the RS in<lb/> this study.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are wide variations in designing a TTO in-<lb/>strument. <ref type="biblio">23</ref> Conventional lifetime TTO where a re-<lb/>spondent trades against unwanted premature death<lb/> originated from Torrance et al. <ref type="biblio">(1976)</ref>. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> The Buck-<lb/>ingham et al. <ref type="biblio">(1996)</ref> experiment used two other vari-<lb/>ations: annual TTO where a respondent trades<lb/> against unwanted convalescence, and daily TTO<lb/> where a respondent trades against unwanted sleep in<lb/> a day. The use of daily TTO is most recommended<lb/> among these three, because it produces more consis-<lb/>tent results. <ref type="biblio">26<lb/></ref> We constructed our questions for the TTO (Box 1)<lb/> featuring cedar pollinosis instead of allergic rhinitis<lb/> as the disease under consideration, although the de-<lb/>scriptions of health statuses are in accordance with<lb/> the clinical stratification of allergic rhinitis symptoms<lb/> and severity. This is because featured pollinosis is<lb/> more common and therefore it could attract more at-<lb/>tention than stating allergic rhinitis. We devised a<lb/> monthly TTO taking advantage of seasonality that is<lb/> quite well-known to the general public. One month of<lb/> continuous suffering is considered easy to imagine by<lb/> the respondents. In our monthly TTO, the respon-<lb/>dent trades against unwanted sleep in a month. Un-<lb/>wanted sleep metaphor for dead status, which is simi-<lb/>lar to daily TTO employed after pilot testing was ad-<lb/>ministered to several collaborators.<lb/></p>

			<p>Every respondent was repeatedly questioned four<lb/> times in order to fill the four separate answer sheets<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), imagining the sufferings of each severity<lb/> level of symptoms explained in the clinical stratifica-<lb/>tion (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). They were asked to check &apos;Yes&apos; or &apos;No&apos;<lb/> regarding medication according to the length of un-<lb/>wanted sleep. The level, at which answer changes<lb/> from &apos;Yes&apos; to &apos;No&apos;, was judged as an indication of the<lb/> point of indifference in the trade-off. Utility weights<lb/> were calculated by the following formula:<lb/></p>

			<p>Utility weight ＝<lb/> 30 − Number of acceptable sleeping days<lb/> 30<lb/></p>

			<p>The questionnaire starts with a face sheet on the<lb/> characteristics of the respondent, followed by an ex-<lb/>planation of clinical stratification of allergic rhinitis<lb/> symptoms and severity. Then, for each level of sever-<lb/>ity of symptoms, the respondent is asked to rate his!<lb/> her preference from 0 points (dead) to 100 points<lb/> (perfect health) on the visual analogue scale. The RS<lb/> is incorporated before the TTO questions for the pur-<lb/>pose of warm-up and engaging respondents, as well<lb/> as for the comparison with the results by TTO.<lb/></p>

			<p>The questionnaire as above was used in our com-<lb/>munity survey, of which samples were selected by<lb/> stratified systematic sampling from the basic resident<lb/> register of Tsukuba city, Ibaraki prefecture in Japan.<lb/> It is an academic and garden city located in the sub-<lb/>urbs of Tokyo. 300 samples in total were selected by<lb/> sex and age stratum of 20-39, 40-59 and 60+. Adults<lb/> of age 20 and over were chosen, since we considered<lb/> that this did not have a serious bias in the representa-<lb/>tiveness of social preference. These sex and age cate-<lb/>gories were set for the purpose of examining the reli-<lb/>ability of results. On the face sheet, existence of cur-<lb/></p>

			<p>rent nasal symptoms and history of cedar pollinosis<lb/> were also asked, so that effects of these factors on the<lb/> reliability of the results could be examined. We as-<lb/>sumed that there was no difference between allergic<lb/> rhinitis patients and non-patients regarding the un-<lb/>derstanding of suffering experiences classified in the<lb/> clinical stratification of severity. Therefore, no signifi-<lb/>cant difference was also expected between utility<lb/> weights and the history.<lb/> The questionnaire was delivered by post, followed<lb/> by the investigator visiting to collect responses at a<lb/> later date. The survey was conducted in November of<lb/> 2005 when cedar pollens were not scattered in the<lb/> air.<lb/></p>

			<p>a response rate of 51.0%.<lb/> Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the characteristics of the respon-<lb/>dents. There were 68 males and 78 females.

Here, a statistically significant<lb/> difference in the response rate was found by the χ 2<lb/> test. The older the age strata, the higher the re-<lb/>sponse rate. 31.5% of respondents reported currently<lb/> experiencing nasal symptoms, while 33.6% reported<lb/> having a past history of cedar pollinosis, of which av-<lb/>erage years of suffering was 12.5 years. A statistical<lb/> association was found between current nasal symp-<lb/>toms and history of cedar pollinosis by the χ 2 test, de-<lb/>spite the survey being conducted during out of cedar<lb/> pollen season. This may be due to the comorbidity of<lb/> perennial allergic rhinitis or pollen allergy other than<lb/> cedar. <ref type="biblio">26<lb/></ref> Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows utility weights by severity with the<lb/> RS and TTO. Utility weights with RS by the four lev-<lb/>els of severity are 0.82, 0.71, 0.56 and 0.43 from mild<lb/> to severest symptoms, respectively, while with TTO,<lb/> 0.96, 0.94, 0.89 and 0.83, respectively. Lower weights<lb/> found by RS may be due to the known tendency in<lb/> the response to RS that respondents are more in-<lb/>clined to mark the point apart from extreme ends of<lb/> the scale. <ref type="biblio">15</ref></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>We elicited utility weights for allergic rhinitis by the<lb/> level of standard clinical stratification of severity de-<lb/>fined by the Practical Guideline for the Management<lb/> of Allergic Rhinitis in Japan. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> We constructed a self-<lb/>administered questionnaire applying monthly TTO<lb/> for representative samples from the community. Util-<lb/>ity weights by the four levels of severity were found<lb/> to be 0.96, 0.94, 0.89 and 0.83, from mild to severest<lb/> symptoms, respectively. The average weight of these,<lb/> 0.91, can be judged as consistent with the formerly<lb/> reported 0.89 for seasonal allergic rhinitis and 0.97<lb/> for perennial allergic rhinitis in Japan, taking into ac-<lb/>count that EQ-5D was applied to patients in this study<lb/> and that seasonal rhinitis patients experience severer<lb/> symptoms than perennial rhinitis patients. <ref type="biblio">9</ref> Addition-<lb/>ally, the weights found were stable regardless of re-<lb/>spondents&apos; characteristics such as sex, age, current<lb/> nasal symptoms, or history of cedar pollinosis, which<lb/> allows us to consider the findings of this study as be-<lb/>ing fairly reliable for social preference.<lb/></p>

			<p>In particular, we choose to elicit the preference of<lb/> the general public as a social preference assuming<lb/> that individuals without any history of allergic rhinitis<lb/> can imagine the various symptoms of rhinitis. If this<lb/> is not the case, there may be a difference in results<lb/> between subgroups of those with a history of allergic<lb/> rhinitis and those without it. Such a difference may<lb/> raise the problem of how to interpret these as social<lb/> preference. However, no significant differences were<lb/> found in this study.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a point to be noted in interpreting our re-<lb/>sults. Non-response by almost half of the samples<lb/> raises a concern about the ease of answering to our<lb/> devised self-administered TTO questionnaire. How-<lb/>ever, the response rate of 51.0% is more than the<lb/> usual response rates of mail surveys, and comparable<lb/> to those of several recent governmental interview sur-<lb/>veys, 40-50%, of which decline is considered to be<lb/> due to the citizen&apos;s amounting awareness on privacy<lb/> backed up by the enforcement of Personal Informa-<lb/>tion Protection Act in April of 2005. <ref type="biblio">27</ref> The response<lb/> rate of 51.0% may be judged as low, but it has become<lb/> unrealistic to obtain more representative data in Ja-<lb/>pan. <ref type="biblio">27</ref> Therefore, the level of response rate of our sur-<lb/>vey can be interpreted as independent from the ease<lb/> of answering, and the questionnaire itself can be con-<lb/>sidered feasible for self-administration.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although the clinical stratification of severity em-<lb/>ployed in this study is based on Japanese guidelines,<lb/> the description of symptoms and severities are uni-<lb/>versal enough to be used in other countries. And<lb/> found weights were not so different from 0.87, which<lb/> is reported for hay fever! allergic rhinitis from the<lb/> U.S., although the severity of symptoms is not stated<lb/> in this study. <ref type="biblio">28</ref> Our results may be applicable to eco-<lb/>nomic evaluations regarding allergic rhinitis in vari-<lb/>ous contexts in many countries, such as transitioning<lb/> of the second-generation antihistamines to over-the-<lb/>counter status <ref type="biblio">29,30</ref> or a tablet-based vaccination<lb/> against hay fever. <ref type="biblio">31-33<lb/></ref> We devised a monthly TTO by taking advantage of<lb/> seasonality that is quite well-known to the general<lb/> public. The monthly TTO is a new variation that is in-<lb/>between annual TTO and daily TTO, of which con-<lb/>struct validity is ensured. However, empirical com-<lb/>parison with annual TTO and daily TTO may be nec-<lb/>essary, which was not exercised in this study. This<lb/> leaves room for further study. <ref type="biblio">Arnesen and Trom-<lb/>mald (2005)</ref> point out that variation in TTO questions<lb/> could undermine the comparability of QALYs across<lb/> diverse health statuses, and suggests that a detailed<lb/> description of the implemented TTO is one way to re-<lb/>lieve this problem. <ref type="biblio">34</ref> This paper transparently pre-<lb/>sents information required for comparison and dupli-<lb/>cation of technique.</p>
