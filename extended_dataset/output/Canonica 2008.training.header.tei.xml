	<div type="abstract">Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common, costly, and trou-<lb/>blesome condition, impairing patients&apos; quality of life (QoL),<lb/> cognitive function, and productivity. Patients with AR report dis-<lb/>turbed sleep, fatigue, irritability, and a range of practical problems.<lb/> However, there is a relative lack of data on how patients with AR<lb/> perceive their QoL.<lb/> Objective: To better understand how patients perceive AR and their<lb/> attitudes toward this condition (including QoL) and its treatment<lb/> options.<lb/> Methods: An online and telephone survey of 3635 people identified<lb/> as having outdoor and indoor allergies, urticaria, and/or pet allergies<lb/> was performed in 6 countries.<lb/> Results: The survey confirmed that patients with allergies perceive<lb/> their symptoms as causing significant disruptions to their daily lives.<lb/> Respondents were affected for a considerable part of each day, with<lb/> the most severe symptoms occurring in the morning. The most im-<lb/>portant desired effect of medication was the restoration of normal<lb/> breathing, and the most highly rated attributes of the Bideal[ AR drug<lb/> were efficacy, safety, and freedom from undesirable side effects.<lb/> Conclusions: The information gathered from allergy sufferers who<lb/> participated in this survey sheds light on the degree to which people<lb/> with allergies are affected by their disease and the limitations imposed<lb/> by associated symptoms.<lb/></div>
