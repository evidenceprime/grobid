			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one of the <lb/>most common types of digestive NETs. The inci-<lb/>dence of detected rectal NETs has increased in the <lb/>past few decades due to the increased number of <lb/>colonoscopies. 1-5 As rectal NETs &lt;10 mm in size carry <lb/>a low risk of lymph node metastasis, 6-9 current guide-<lb/>lines recommend local excision including endoscopic <lb/>resection (ER) for these tumors. 10 <lb/>There are many established ER methods, including <lb/>conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (c-EMR), 11 <lb/>endoscopic submucosal resection with band ligation <lb/>(ESMR-L), 12 endoscopic submucosal resection with cap <lb/>aspiration (ESMR-C), 13 EMR after circumferential inci-<lb/>sion (precutting EMR), 14 and endoscopic submucosal <lb/>dissection (ESD). 15 Of these, especially ESMR-L and <lb/>ESD are commonly performed procedures for rectal <lb/>NET resection in daily clinical practice. Several reports <lb/>address the efficacy of modified EMR (ESMR-L, ESMR-<lb/>C, and precutting EMR) and ESD. 16-19 However, most <lb/>of these reports are from a single high-volume center, <lb/>and there are a few from multiple facilities. Furthermore, <lb/>there have been no reports focused on the impact of <lb/>the endoscopist&apos;s experience on treatment outcomes for <lb/>each of these ER methods. Thus, additional evidence is <lb/>required to establish an optimal strategy for ER in rectal <lb/>NETs. Therefore, we surveyed the results of ER treat-<lb/>ments for small rectal NETs in a multi-center database, <lb/>focusing on a comparison between ESMR-L and ESD. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>Patients <lb/>This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of <lb/>patients who underwent ESMR-L or ESD from 2010 to <lb/>2019 for rectal NETs &lt;10 mm in size. This study was <lb/>conducted at 11 Japanese facilities, including univer-<lb/>sity hospitals, general hospitals, and practicing clinics. <lb/>Relevant data of the patients and lesions collected <lb/>from the clinical records were analyzed. The evalu-<lb/>ation items were as follows: clinical background of <lb/>the patient, the ER method, the procedure time, per-<lb/>forations and postoperative bleeding as complications, <lb/>the R0 resection rate, and the hospitalization period. <lb/>Patients who were treated other than by ESMR-L or <lb/>ESD, such as by c-EMR, ESMR-C, or precutting EMR, <lb/>were excluded. Patients with multiple lesions were also <lb/>excluded. <lb/>Written informed consent was obtained from all <lb/>patients prior to treatment. This study was approved <lb/>by the Ethical Committee of Kumamoto University <lb/>Hospital (approval number 2015) and performed in <lb/>accordance with the ethical principles associated with <lb/>the Declaration of Helsinki. <lb/>Endoscopic procedures <lb/>In accordance with the guidelines, rectal NETs less <lb/>than 10 mm without obvious muscular invasion or <lb/>metastasis were indicated for ER. Most cases were <lb/>treated after the histological diagnosis of NET by endo-<lb/>scopic biopsies. Prior to the procedure, endoscopic <lb/>ultrasonography to rule out muscle layer invasion and <lb/>computed tomography to rule out metastases were <lb/>usually performed. <lb/>In the ESMR-L procedure, the lesion is aspirated <lb/>and ligated using a ligation device (Sumitomo Bakelite <lb/>Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) after submucosal injection, and <lb/>resected with a snare placed below the ligation band. <lb/>Routinely, saline was used for submucosal injection, and <lb/>endoscopic closure of mucosal defects was with clips <lb/>after resection. <lb/></body>

			<body>In the ESD procedure, incision and deeper cutting cre-<lb/>ate a mucosal flap after submucosal injection; thereafter, <lb/>a circumferential incision with submucosal dissection is <lb/>performed until the tumor can be completely removed. <lb/>A Dual knife (KD-650Q; Olympus) or a Flush knife <lb/>(DK2618JB; Fujifilm) was mainly used for the ESD pro-<lb/>cedure. Coagulation was occasionally performed with <lb/>hemostatic forceps for the exposed vessels after resec-<lb/>tion. Routinely, 0.4% hyaluronic acid (MucoUP; Boston <lb/>Scientific Japan Co.) was used, and endoscopic closure <lb/>for mucosal defects was not conducted after resection. <lb/>All of the procedures were carried out by a total of 60 <lb/>different endoscopists. The choice of ER method was <lb/>made by each endoscopist. <lb/>Histological evaluation <lb/>Hematoxylin-Eosin and immunohistochemical staining <lb/>(chromogranin A, synaptophysin) was performed on <lb/>formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples after ER. <lb/>Tumor size, invasion depth, lymphatic and vascular <lb/>involvement, and tumor involvement in the lateral and <lb/>vertical margins, were histologically assessed. The <lb/>lympho-vascular invasion was usually evaluated by <lb/>immunostaining (CD34, Victoria blue, and D2-40). Ki-<lb/>67 was used to evaluate cell proliferation and classify <lb/>the grade of the tumor. Grade 1 was defined as hav-<lb/>ing a mitotic count &lt;2 per 10 high-power fields and/or <lb/>Ki67 ≤2%. The pathological diagnosis was based on the <lb/>2010 World Health Organization classification of tumors <lb/>of the digestive system. <lb/>Definition <lb/>The procedure time was defined as the time from inser-<lb/>tion to the removal of the endoscope. Perforation was <lb/>defined as a visible hole in the rectum wall recog-<lb/>nized during the procedure, or free air detected by <lb/>abdominal computed tomography after the procedure. <lb/>Postoperative bleeding was defined as the presence <lb/>of fresh bloody stool, which required urgent endoscopy <lb/>for hemostasis. R0 resection was defined as en bloc <lb/>resection with tumor-free lateral and vertical margins. <lb/>&quot;Experienced&quot; endoscopists were defined as having <lb/>performed more than 3000 colonoscopies and 500 <lb/>colonic c-EMR and/or 30 colonic ESD at each point of <lb/>treatment. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>Clinical outcomes were analyzed using the Mann-<lb/>Whitney U test, Student&apos;s t-test, Fisher&apos;s exact test, or <lb/>chi-squared test, as appropriate. Multivariate logistic and <lb/>linear regression models were also employed based <lb/>on propensity scores to adjust for candidate confound-<lb/>ing factors. To generate the propensity score, logistic <lb/>regression was performed using the ER method as the <lb/>outcome, and the five variables were age, sex, tumor <lb/>location, tumor size, and endoscopists&apos; experience. Lin-<lb/>ear regression models using patients from each medical <lb/>facility as a cluster were employed to evaluate asso-<lb/>ciations between treatment and outcome. In addition, <lb/>the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) <lb/>method based on propensity scoring was used to esti-<lb/>mate the average treatment effect of ESMR-L compared <lb/>to ESD. In these models, outcome variables such as <lb/>ESD procedure time or dissection speed were log-<lb/>transformed because of their skewed distribution. Thus, <lb/>in the multivariate linear regression models, the ESMR-L <lb/>and ESD procedure times were compared by estimating <lb/>the exponentials of regression coefficients. Probability <lb/>values for statistical tests were two-tailed and p &lt; 0.05 <lb/>was considered significant. Statistical analysis was per-<lb/>formed with R version 3.3.3 (R Foundation, Vienna, <lb/>Austria), and STATA15.1 (StataCorp, Lakeway Drive, <lb/>Texas). <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>From January 2010 to December 2019, a total of 218 <lb/>patients who underwent ER for rectal NETs &lt;10 mm <lb/>enrolled from 11 institutions for this study. Of these, we <lb/>excluded 10 patients who underwent ER by a method <lb/>other than ESMR-L or ESD (these were four c-EMR, five <lb/>ESMR-C, and one precutting EMR). We also excluded <lb/>three patients who had multiple NET lesions resected <lb/>in a single procedure. Hence, we finally analyzed 205 <lb/>patients, 89 of whom were treated by ESMR-L, and 116 <lb/>by ESD. The study flowchart is shown in Figure 1. <lb/>The characteristics of the patients and their lesions <lb/>are shown in Table 1. The lesions were mainly located <lb/>in the lower rectum (n = 177, 86%), and the median <lb/>tumor size was 5 mm. The mean age of the patients who <lb/>underwent ESD was higher than that of ESMR-L (53±13 <lb/>years vs. 58 ± 13 years, p = 0.02), and the median tumor <lb/>size in the former was larger (4 mm vs. 5 mm, p &lt; 0.01). <lb/>The proportion of experienced endoscopists was signif-<lb/>icantly greater than for ESD compared to ESMR-L (80% <lb/>vs. 55%, p = 0.04). <lb/>Table 2 depicts the univariate analysis of treatment <lb/>outcomes. All lesions were resected en bloc either by <lb/>ESMR-L or ESD, with no significant difference in the R0 <lb/>resection rate (90% vs. 92%, p = 0.73). The procedure <lb/>time was significantly shorter for ESMR-L than for ESD <lb/>patients (17 min vs. 52 min, p &lt; 0.01), and the hospi-<lb/>talization period was also shorter for ESMR-L patients <lb/>(3 days vs. 5 days, p&lt; 0.01). No instance of perforation <lb/>was found in any of the patients, and the rate of post-<lb/>operative bleeding was not significantly different (7% vs. <lb/>2%, p = 0.14). All cases of postoperative bleeding were <lb/></body>

We also <lb/>showed the clinical outcomes of each 11 institutions in <lb/>Table S1. <lb/>Multivariate regression analysis was then applied to <lb/>compare ESMR-L with ESD, confirming that the proce-<lb/>dure time was significantly shorter for the former (odds <lb/>ratio = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26-0.40, p <lb/>&lt; 0.001) and that the R0 resection rate was not signif-<lb/>icantly different (odds ratio = 0.62, 95% CI 0.08-4.58, <lb/>p = 0.641; Table 3). The hospitalization period was also <lb/>confirmed to be significantly shorter after ESMR-L (odds <lb/>ratio = 0.45, 95% CI 0.24-0.86, p = 0.021; Table 3). <lb/>In the IPTW analysis, the estimated mean procedure <lb/>time when using the ESMR-L method was also signif-<lb/>icantly shorter than for ESD (odds ratio = 0.33, 95% <lb/>CI 0.27-0.41, p &lt; 0.001), and again, the R0 resection <lb/>rate was not significantly different (odds ratio = 0.98, <lb/>95% CI 0.89-1.07, p = 0.614; Table 3). The hospital-<lb/>ization period was also significantly shorter for patients <lb/>after ESMR-L (odds ratio = 0.46, 95% CI 0.39-0.53, p &lt; <lb/>0.001; Table 3). <lb/>In the subgroup analysis, we evaluated the impact <lb/>of the endoscopist&apos;s experience on the technical out-<lb/>comes for each ER method. For the ESMR-L, there was <lb/>no difference in procedure time between experienced <lb/>and less-experienced endoscopists (17 min vs. 17 min, <lb/>p = 0.269; Table 4). On the other hand, for ESD, the <lb/>median procedure time was longer in cases treated by <lb/>less-experienced endoscopists (49 min vs. 70 min, p = <lb/>0.017;Table 4).There was no significant difference in the <lb/>R0 resection rate whether performed by experienced or <lb/>less-experienced endoscopist both in ESMR-L (86.4% <lb/>vs. 96.7%, p = 0.263; Table 4) and ESD procedure <lb/>(92.5% vs. 91.3%, p &gt; 0.99; Table 4). The hospitalization <lb/>period was longer in both the ESMR-L (2 days vs. 3 days, <lb/>p &lt; 0.023; Table 4) and ESD groups (5 days vs. 8 days, <lb/>p &lt; 0.001; Table 4) when treated by less-experienced <lb/>endoscopists. <lb/>We also examined the impact of endoscopist experi-<lb/>ence level on treatment outcomes using linear or logistic <lb/>regression models adjusted by propensity score. The <lb/>procedure time of ESD was significantly prolonged by <lb/>less-experienced endoscopists (odds ratio = 1.42, 95% <lb/>CI 1.12-1.80, p = 0.009; Table S2), but that of ESMR-L <lb/>was not affected (odds ratio = 1.14, 95% CI 0.92-1.40, <lb/>p = 0.205; Table S2). ESMR-L performed by less-<lb/>experienced endoscopists did not result in lower R0 <lb/>resection rates (odds ratio = 3.94, 95% CI 0.32-47.96, <lb/>p = 0.282; Table S2), and that was also confirmed by the <lb/>ESD procedure (odds ratio = 0.75, 95% CI 0.16-3.53, <lb/>p = 0.716; Table S2). <lb/>In this study, 27 patients (13%) had a lympho-vascular <lb/>invasion. Of which, 13 underwent additional surgery, and <lb/>one of them was found to have lymph node metastasis. <lb/>No apparent lymph node recurrence was observed in <lb/>patients who did not undergo additional surgery. There <lb/>were no confirmed cases of local recurrence during <lb/></body>

			<body>the follow-up period, with a median 35-month (interquar-<lb/>tile range 25%-75%, 14-61) follow-up observation. In <lb/>contrast, a distant metastatic recurrence was confirmed <lb/>in one case in the ESD group. The lesion was NET <lb/>grade 2 of WHO classification, 7 mm in size without <lb/>lympho-vascular invasion, and the horizontal and ver-<lb/>tical margins were free. However, the patient did not <lb/>accept the additional surgery. After more than 9 years <lb/>passed since the ESD procedure, multiple liver masses <lb/>were pointed out, and the biopsy revealed a recurrence <lb/>of NET. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>In this retrospective study for rectal NETs &lt;10 mm <lb/>in size, the patients who underwent ESMR-L required <lb/>a significantly shorter procedure and shorter hospi-<lb/>talization period than those who underwent ESD, but <lb/>there was no difference in the R0 resection rate. These <lb/>results were confirmed after adjusting for confound-<lb/>ing factors using both multivariate analysis and the <lb/>IPTW method. Interestingly, the level of endoscopists&apos; <lb/>experience significantly affected the procedure time <lb/>for ESD more than for ESMR-L, and ESMR-L per-<lb/>formed by less-experienced endoscopists did not result <lb/>in lower R0 resection rates. Both resection meth-<lb/>ods resulted in a longer hospitalization period when <lb/>treated by less-experienced endoscopists. There was <lb/>no significant difference in the complication rates by <lb/>endoscopist&apos;s experience. This might be because the <lb/>patients treated by less-experienced endoscopists had <lb/>a longer hospital stay after treatment and were followed <lb/>more carefully. <lb/>In our study, the R0 resection rate was not significantly <lb/>different between ESMR-L and ESD (90% vs. 92%, p <lb/>= 0.73), similar to what has been previously reported <lb/>(81%-100%, 54%-100%, respectively). 12-25 However, <lb/>our simulation using the data of this study revealed <lb/>that the statistical power to verify the non-inferiority of <lb/>ESMR-L compared to ESD was low (&lt;0.1), suggesting <lb/>the necessity of further investigations with a large sam-<lb/>ple size. There have been two meta-analyses comparing <lb/>ESD and modified EMR, which include ESMR-L and <lb/>EMR-C, as ER methods for rectal NETs. 26,27 The latest <lb/>meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the <lb/>R0 resection rate between ESMR-L and ESD, consistent <lb/>with our results. All of these previous reports found that <lb/>the procedure time of ESMR-L was significantly shorter <lb/>than ESD, as we also found. Most of these reports were <lb/>from a single high-volume center, and the number of <lb/>cases in each report was small. Hence, in contrast, our <lb/>study had a relatively large number of cases from multi-<lb/>ple institutions, including the university hospital, general <lb/>hospitals, and practicing clinics. The guidelines did not <lb/>specify which resection method is recommended. 10,28 <lb/>Additional evidence is still needed. <lb/>In most cases for which R0 resection was not <lb/>achieved, the vertical margins were either unclear or <lb/>positive. Free vertical margins are the most important <lb/>for achieving the complete resection of small rectal <lb/>NETS. For the ESD procedure, the submucosal dis-<lb/>section should be performed just above the muscular <lb/>layer in order to avoid the burning effect on the tumor. <lb/>However,this procedure benefits from more experienced <lb/>endoscopic skills and entails a longer procedure time. In <lb/>contrast, ESMR-L is a relatively simple and rapid proce-<lb/>dure not requiring so much endoscopic experience and <lb/>skill. For this reason, the endoscopist&apos;s experience sig-<lb/>nificantly affected the procedure time of ESD more than <lb/>ESMR-L. ESMR-L also has an economic advantage <lb/>because it does not require the use of various differ-<lb/>ent endoscopic knives, hemostat forceps, and expensive <lb/>liquids for submucosal injection. In addition, a shorter <lb/>hospitalization period is favorable in terms of medical <lb/>costs. <lb/>All of the horizontal margins were negative in the ESD <lb/>group, whereas three cases of horizontal margins were <lb/>unclear in the ESMR-L group.This may be due to the fact <lb/>that specimens after ESMR-L were often not stretched <lb/>and fixed on the board before being fixed in formalin. <lb/>Although no additional surgical resection was performed <lb/>in these three cases with unclear horizontal margins, <lb/>none of them had obvious local recurrence. Of the three <lb/>patients with unclear horizontal margins, two also had <lb/>unclear vertical margins. Only one patient had unclear <lb/>horizontal margins with free vertical margins. This lesion <lb/>was located near the scar of c-EMR that had been per-<lb/>formed previously. ESD would be better indicated for <lb/>such a lesion near the scar because of its flexibility in <lb/>the resection area. ESD would also be more suitable <lb/>for large rectal NET lesions, although it is not usually <lb/>indicated for ER. <lb/>There is no definitive consensus on the definition <lb/>of &quot;experienced&quot; endoscopists. In the systematic liter-<lb/>ature review of learning curves for colorectal polyp <lb/>resection techniques, 29 higher en bloc and complete <lb/>resection rates were achieved in 50-300 cases with the <lb/>colonic c-EMR procedure and 20-40 cases with <lb/>the ESD procedure. Furthermore, it was reported that <lb/>the procedural speed was increased after 30 cases <lb/>in the ESD procedure. Because only a few endoscopists <lb/>had extensive experience with ESMR-L procedures and <lb/>colorectal ESD procedures in our study, we also defined <lb/>&quot;experienced&quot; endoscopists with extensive colonoscopy <lb/>and colonic c-EMR experiences. <lb/>Our study has some limitations. First, this is a ret-<lb/>rospective analysis of procedures. The choice of ER <lb/>methods was dependent on the institution and the oper-<lb/>ator, and there were no clear criteria. Although we have <lb/>adjusted for candidate confounding factors, it might be <lb/>a major selection bias. Second, the timing of treatment <lb/>might affect the technical results since the duration of <lb/>our study period was 10 years. Third, because this study <lb/></body>

			<body>focused on treatment outcomes, the long-term outcome <lb/>data were insufficient to draw any conclusions in later <lb/>clinical courses. Forth, the procedure time of our study <lb/>seemed to be longer than in the previous reports.It might <lb/>be due to the definition of procedure time as the time <lb/>from insertion to the removal of the endoscope. Despite <lb/>these limitations,the strength of our study is that it exam-<lb/>ined the impact of endoscopists´experience on each <lb/>ER method for rectal NETs with a relatively large num-<lb/>ber of cases, and analyzed the treatment outcome of <lb/>many endoscopists a further strength. <lb/>In conclusion, compared with ESD, ESMR-L had <lb/>a shorter procedure time and shorter hospitalization <lb/>period despite the similar R0 resection rate and com-<lb/>plication rate. The procedure time of ESD was affected <lb/>by the endoscopists&apos;experience but that of ESMR-L was <lb/>not. Therefore, ESMR-L is considered to be a more effi-<lb/>cient treatment method than ESD for small rectal NETs, <lb/>especially for less-experienced endoscopists. <lb/></body>
